22,210950968,Martin_Atchet_,1900-01-29 00:53:54, In general you shouldn’t care about burning cards unless you’re worried about fatigue. Kibler wrote an article about it. You’re just as likely to burn a good card as you are to get a card closer to a good card.

24,210950968,awooga,1900-01-29 00:56:09," As Good as It Gets is a 1997 American romantic comedy film directed by James L. Brooks. It stars Jack Nicholson as a misanthropic and obsessive-compulsive novelist, Helen Hunt as a single mother with a chronically ill son, and Greg Kinnear as a gay artist. The screenplay was written by Mark Andrus and Brooks. The paintings were created for the film by New York artist Billy Sullivan.[2]"

And started in video sketch (got a new one pinned on my reddit page if you care to check it out) but have been doing the stand up thing for the last 5 years. This particular joke is one I’ve done on stage a bunch and it’s quite consistent, but think it benefits from my pauses and delivery. That being said it doesn’t necessarily make it the best stand up shot. Regardless thanks for the comment and appreciate feedback both positive and constructive. Have a good one!"

I use the Head Massager for foreplay. If ‘Mr. Happy’ doesn’t want to play I ‘Pump’ up his ego. Then the Receiver strokes me into ecstasy. My partner loves her nipples massaged while she is riding her Sybian. Venus truly does it all! What fantastic products."

0,619334074,Nightbot,1900-04-11 00:01:20," The other type of star is pure personality, like the wildly funny and inventive comedy stream ""Go Off Kings."" These types are basically amateur gamers who captivate for reasons that have nothing to do with skilled gaming. Part podcast, part reality show and part friends chilling on the couch, this type of streamer's world is so inviting and fun it sucks you in."

So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today."
