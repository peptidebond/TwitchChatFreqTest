[0:01:20] <Nightbot> The other type of star is pure personality, like the wildly funny and inventive comedy stream "Go Off Kings." These types are basically amateur gamers who captivate for reasons that have nothing to do with skilled gaming. Part podcast, part reality show and part friends chilling on the couch, this type of streamer's world is so inviting and fun it sucks you in.
[0:01:20] <Nightbot> I walk out here every night with hustle loyalty and respect on my sleeve. That is a credo that I have adopted from the men and women who defend the freedom of this country. We have caught and compromised to a permanent end: Osama. Bin. Laden. This is something tonight. But I feel damn proud to be an American.
[0:01:25] <Nightbot> WEDNESDAY. The day you flumpty-foo! And you think boopty-bop and zippity-zoom but the truth is, razza frazza wuzza wooza. What I’m trying to say is, maybe your brain isn’t working either, but that’s OK, because you’re great. PS you need a firmware upgrade in the form of “coffee.”

[0:54:02] <bobricebobrice> !bundt
[0:54:02] <Nightbot> I bought a bundt cake for Jesse about a month ago. When I brought it home, he got irritated because he has been trying to eat healthier. So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today.

[0:55:57] <Down10_> the streams have hundreds
[0:55:58] <foygus_> hundreds of people have used me
[0:56:00] <alejandroid69> quibiblio is better
[0:56:06] <8thart> i assume they mean per day or active or whatever right
[0:56:13] <splinkerbell> jesus how much did they spend on that thing
[0:56:15] <buttbuttpeeman> Does that mean you guys get 1.5billion too then?
[0:56:18] <shoe3482> fierce queens
[0:56:20] <IncrediDick> chrissy's court

[0:56:23] <europeansheep> feel bad for cait
[0:56:26] <gulpo19> are you beating the golden arm?
[0:56:27] <shoe3482> I call this broadcast "Fierce Kings"
[0:56:29] <chuck420blazer> what about the chrissy teigen show
[0:56:33] <sputnik111> go off kings vs fierce queens
[0:56:34] <bobricebobrice> #ad
[0:56:34] <DaveGrier> hang on did they make new vertical eps of reno 911

[0:57:04] <8thart> my GF got a switch lite what are good games besides the obvious AC/Odyssey/Kart/Pokemon
[0:57:05] <Nightbot> Heep
[0:57:06] <BloodWorms> yeah, i have a complaint: quibiblio mode isn't narrow enough!
[0:57:06] <buttbuttpeeman> Someone is breaking into your house Stefan.
[0:57:06] <braddawson> theyre like #10 on the app store
[0:57:07] <LRonFrancis> that's on a free trial if anything
[0:57:12] <Timb0nic> If Quibi dies I would be so happy
[0:57:14] <ghoulsnightout_> Every quibi show I’ve worked on is trash
[0:57:17] <sputnik111> I blame everything on corona viris
[0:57:17] <farthammer1> Hot Take: the Puddle Of Mudd cover is just as mediocre as the Nirvana version. Dave Grohl was the real talent.
[0:57:22] <glockaspaniel> when will quibi embrace porno
[0:57:24] <bobricebobrice> @8thart octopath was great to me
[0:57:25] <shoe3482> @braddawson I heard they are at like #150
[0:57:26] <scubadoo2188> Chris is playing the company man because NEAS just got picked up by Quibi
[0:57:26] <BroPair> ban farthammer please
[0:57:29] <DaveGrier> @8thart Octopath Traveler rules if she every liked SNES RPGs
[0:57:32] <dropkickchannel> Quibi needs to do a brand refresh and change their name to Qwikster
[0:57:34] <uoenodoe> Fi Fa Fo Fum is very smart Chris
[0:57:34] <chrome_chomsky> its only a phone app
[0:57:39] <twotontesticle> Isn’t there a show on there about a woman who loves her golden arm?
[0:57:40] <8thart> nice
[0:57:42] <oldnick42> No way, they are not being as strict as 7 days with active users.
[0:57:49] <gulpo19> what percentage will cancel the day after they charge everyone's credit card the first time?
[0:57:49] <apebot3214> $2 billion dollars can pay for a lot of Chrisy's Court though
[0:57:52] <yeeeeeeboiiii> Stefan turns off the stream and tries to hold back tears while standing over a mountain of broken dishes
[0:57:52] <nckbsl> App usage is normally reported in Daily Active Users, but Quibi wouldn't wan't to report that. It's more likely that they're reporting ALL accounts created.
[0:57:55] <shoe3482> on 4/17 Quibi was below 70 in the app store
[0:57:55] <tuffghost> oh you have to pay for it? lol
[0:57:56] <pbostrom> were you holding your phone vertically?
[0:57:58] <SoundAlerts> usernamehaver played Chris Toilet for 25 Bits
[0:58:03] <oldnick42> Jesse they are definitely counting anyone who has ever watched anything in the last 90 days (so the whole life of the app).
[0:58:04] <jamberg> oh dang new twitch layout
[0:58:20] <sputnik111> dan Harmon sex doll show
[0:58:21] <therudebeast> if "beef house" was on quibi i'd pay double for it
[0:58:23] <ajwkw> sick goal
[0:58:35] <gulpo19> golden arm was sam raimi so definitely intentionally weird
[0:58:40] <8thart> if i got punk'd and chance hte rapper walked out i'd punch him in face
[0:58:45] <oldnick42> There's not a firm definition of "active users" so they'll use whatever makes them look best.
[0:58:47] <jamberg> is it????
[0:58:50] <MarsIsWaiting> hm
[0:58:50] <supimscott> Jesse what was the breaking news
[0:58:50] <shoe3482> the dan harmon shit is for freaks
[0:58:51] <LilacWhimski> he talked about that doll on harmontown a bunch
[0:58:52] <sixbynine> she made a show about it to be fair
[0:58:52] <BroPair> the show is called The Dan Harmon Story
[0:58:55] <rodzirvin> T-Mobile makes you choose between free Netflix for a year or free Quibi for a year @GoOffKings
[0:58:55] <jazzisking> yeah its called freaking rick and morty
[0:58:55] <therudebeast> it's just a quibi
[0:58:57] <EpochError> garry anderson has a show on there
[0:58:58] <jamberg> raimi is inscrutable at times
[0:59:00] <shoe3482> JF whats the breaking news
[0:59:04] <below_the_salt> jesse you had some news to share
[0:59:04] <ghoulsnightout_> Remember when chance the rapper cried to mtv about a bad review of his album
[0:59:05] <wwardlaw> Just shy of a jiffy
[0:59:06] <Down10_> 5 seconds
[0:59:06] <alejandroid69> they should put porno on there
[0:59:07] <bobricebobrice> 8 minutes or so
[0:59:09] <hectordoink> I'd prefer Slobi's TBH
[0:59:13] <haterdeluxe> 75 minutes
[0:59:13] <IncrediDick> a quibi lasts for one quibi
[0:59:14] <apebot3214> Like 8 minutes
[0:59:17] <Down10_> They should put porno on there!
[0:59:17] <farthammer1> The latest season of Reno 911! has the same amount of viewers as Stefan with a backwards hat trying to get people to watch Joey's World Tour
[0:59:25] <jamberg> in conclusion, it's an elaborate union busting scheme
[0:59:28] <chrome_chomsky> yeah
[0:59:28] <bobricebobrice> SAG minimums
[0:59:42] <shoe3482> yeah I would download it if there was porno
[0:59:43] <therudebeast> it's somehow related to how youtube doesn't let you put midroll ads in until you have a 10 minute video
[0:59:44] <ArtMoney> crazy, banks aren't even open now
[0:59:47] <bobricebobrice> (idk what that means tbh)
[0:59:48] <shoe3482> the Turnstyle mode is also insane
[0:59:50] <nckbsl> People are more likely to watch a quibi clip on a different platform like Twitter or Youtube.
[0:59:52] <DaveGrier> I could jack off in 8-10 minutes, seems that's the right market
[0:59:53] <farthammer1> Dan Harmon must be awesome to be married to and live with
[0:59:54] <uoenodoe> lol
[0:59:54] <Nightbot> that's funny
[0:59:54] <chuck420blazer> not unless its porn
[0:59:57] <jamberg> it's a SAG loophole
[0:59:58] <dmlat> honestly if its over 1 minute i'm not watching it
[1:00:01] <twotontesticle> That’s more insane than I thought
[1:00:04] <ArtMoney> isnt dan harmon super divorced
[1:00:04] <dmlat> and i'd prefer if it was shorter
[1:00:07] <8thart> idk... after a 3 hr GoK stream sometimes I think maybe short form IS the future of web content! /s
[1:00:18] <dmlat> if i see a 45 second tiktok posted i just miss vine more and more
[1:00:20] <shoe3482> lol
[1:00:21] <dropkickchannel> i'm always tuned in to GoK at the grocery store
[1:00:22] <EpochError> that video rocks
[1:00:23] <hectordoink> the one today was great with the spin kick
[1:00:23] <therudebeast> that fight video was excellent
[1:00:25] <oleskunty> so good
[1:00:31] <therudebeast> that shit was straight street fighter
[1:00:31] <SocialistWaluigi> that last kick was fuckin great
[1:00:32] <wwardlaw> @ArtMoney He remaried arounda year ago
[1:00:34] <jamberg> if somebody sends me an instagram video that's longer than 8 seconds i am replying with a "lol" and never watching it
[1:00:34] <CoolHand_Sean> the neighbour fight?
[1:00:34] <chrome_chomsky> was that the kick guy
[1:00:34] <shoe3482> he looked like Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop
[1:00:35] <thiccmoranis> incredible kicks
[1:00:37] <sputnik111> imagine streaming quibi in canada paying 50$ a month for 1gb of data
[1:00:38] <shoe3482> Jeet Kune Do style
[1:00:45] <migrainethresher> i can't even sit through 3 minutes of porno!
[1:00:45] <europeansheep> gimme the cliffnotes
[1:00:46] <AbstinenceRules> sweat time
[1:00:46] <ghoulsnightout_> Quibi for kids and kids alone is the only thing that makes sense
[1:00:47] <DoogieHowserSpankedMySon> quibi has a nicole richie show where she plays a vegan rapper
[1:00:47] <MarsIsWaiting> JF.... you cant lose by 4...........
[1:00:50] <jamberg> jeff goldblum!
[1:00:55] <8thart> the guy with n oshirt came back with a piece of wood and broke the tall guys arm tho apparently after the video
[1:01:04] <AbstinenceRules> jesse needs a goal
[1:01:10] <emmatown_> @8thart good video

[1:01:40] <horheezy> Quibi's pay scale probably doesn't face the same restrictions because the content is shorter.
[1:01:45] <EpochError> hell id hit the chip button right now
[1:01:49] <supimscott> If you guys tie for the season you have to break the tie by guessing how much stuff on JF’s desk weighs

[1:02:08] <zednaught> it's about a guy who witches
[1:02:09] <love_too_watch_games> oh that was fun
[1:02:11] <shoe3482> not as good as Witcher 3
[1:02:12] <shoe3482> but ok
[1:02:12] <oleskunty> it's solid if you enjoy the games
[1:02:13] <europeansheep> has anyone here seen gangs of london
[1:02:13] <8thart> that goat was cool he was like "im evil"

[1:02:31] <Max_Hanson> no offense jf i dont think your gonna achieve that
[1:02:32] <official_genius> what is he some kind of manwitch?
[1:02:33] <wwardlaw> In interviews he actually seemed to get what was cool about the Witcher
[1:02:34] <sputnik111> and hot af
[1:02:35] <coldslaw69> he does the cool arm thing
[1:02:37] <shoe3482> but hes too big for the role

[1:09:21] <farthammer1> Uncut Gems was overrated anyway
[1:09:28] <dmchandler> @McCainFlightSchool I like when Gotti is told what the 5 boroughs are
[1:09:28] <dropkickchannel> you should watch The Fanatic starring John Travolta, directed by Fred Durst

[1:10:30] <Timb0nic> That's what The Soup was
[1:10:31] <dmchandler> McHale has decent hairplugs as far as those guy tho
[1:10:34] <springbreakmyheart> i like him in community and talk soup.
[1:10:34] <arcademattchristman> Joel mchale and rainn Wilson who's worse?
[1:10:37] <uoenodoe> did anyone watch the fuckin follow up to Tiger King with him? absolutely unwatchable
[1:10:37] <guacamolito> his schtick worked on Comunity and thats it
[1:10:39] <Down10_> I loved The Soup though
[1:10:39] <jamberg> community holds up imo
[1:10:42] <WealthyWalrus> Joel McHale is exactly like his character in community lol
[1:10:42] <bloviated> Credit to Joel Mchale, he has not lingered in the spotlight.
[1:10:42] <depitts> paul blart: mall gestapo
[1:10:45] <batmangioni> JOel McHale = Community immunity

[1:10:49] <bighowellandpossum> I turned on the new episode of tiger king and it was joel mchale and i turned it off like right away
[1:10:51] <hug_nicemann> the soup... pathetic

[1:10:55] <coolermaster88> talk soup
[1:10:55] <therudebeast> i did attempt to make a jerry stiller tribute song last night, it is not very good
[1:10:56] <johntherun06> Community would have been enjoyable without him in it tho
[1:11:01] <BroPair> talk soup used to be good
[1:11:04] <farthammer1> Weird that everyone here hates the tall and ripped successful comedian. Jealous much????
[1:11:07] <Land_Phil> his show about dumb milenials was bad
[1:11:07] <bjork_liker> I like Joel McHale
[1:11:08] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> joel mchale is like larry the cable guy and if he drops the smug prick persona for a moment he'll never get it back again
[1:11:08] <maxbme> hes good as like a mean ryan seacrest guy

[1:11:32] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> i do like him btw
[1:11:32] <bobricebobrice> joel mchale is the guy that wrote the book with megan mccain right?
[1:11:34] <coolermaster88> he was in medical police
[1:11:35] <farthammer1> No lie I liked Joel McHale in Ted

What I’m trying to say is, maybe your brain isn’t working either, but that’s OK, because you’re great. PS you need a firmware upgrade in the form of “coffee.”

[1:24:30] <CoolHand_Sean> get in there fast, don't spare a quibit
[1:24:33] <fermule> shouldn't it be pronounced qui-bye 'cause it's quick bites
[1:24:39] <0mnivore> I would love to see NEAS on Quibiblio
[1:24:44] <fermule> everything.
[1:24:46] <LaOwlLOL> lol
[1:24:51] <skungus> lol
[1:24:53] <McCainFlightSchool> lol
[1:24:58] <chrome_chomsky> who has time to watch things at home?
[1:25:02] <tompeppre> quibi is being run by an insane moron!
[1:25:04] <bloviated> they had a hard time differentiating their brand from quibiblio
[1:25:05] <therudebeast> “I attribute everything that has gone wrong to coronavirus,” Katzenberg said in an interview with The New York Times. “Everything. But we own it.”
[1:25:05] <Timb0nic> but if people were going to work it would be TOTALLY popular
[1:25:07] <machopineapple> You're comparing apples to submarines
[1:25:09] <Timb0nic> suuuuure
[1:25:16] <braddawson> i got laid off so i dont have to take the train anymore yeah
[1:25:19] <SocialistWaluigi> kwibbi
[1:25:19] <CoolHand_Sean> making an entertainment platform that fails when people have to stay at home might be a sign of deeper problems
[1:25:20] <0mnivore> kwiby
[1:25:25] <sharkbutt> it took me several days to realize quibiblio was some bullshit you made up
[1:25:27] <bighowellandpossum> quibi was counting on people watching it on the toilet at work
[1:25:36] <therudebeast> everything that went wrong has to do with covid. not our content or the way it's served up, but covid. and not our content or talent.
[1:25:41] <hug_nicemann> stupid guys know what's up
[1:25:44] <sputnik111> apples to submarins stefan you dont understand. ppl buy bottled water dont they?
[1:25:52] <whatsupfella> im trying to figure that out too lol
[1:25:54] <Chexoid> the bottom cards have yet to be summoned JF
[1:26:04] <forzaroma11> They were hoping we would watch it in line at subway during lunch break at our shitty jobs
[1:26:04] <buttbuttpeeman> Y'all playing Yu-Gi-Oh now?
[1:26:08] <bloviated> you should generally listen to stupid guys
[1:26:13] <bobricebobrice> i would say it's analogous to a "bench" idea
[1:26:15] <springbreakmyheart> they kept advertising on podcasts, which has this weird part of being their competition
[1:26:23] <fermule> man i could go for some subway
[1:26:29] <thurstonfalco> yeah its called bench or back row
[1:26:31] <fermule> this is quarantine sickness
[1:26:32] <bighowellandpossum> you just pick which card is the most random and funny and that person wins the round
[1:26:44] <Timb0nic> Good pitch.
[1:26:47] <DoogieHowserSpankedMySon> that could work
[1:26:50] <jamberg> now that's an idea
[1:26:51] <ArtMoney> that's regular porno
[1:26:51] <whatsupfella> quibi for porno would work so well dude
[1:26:52] <therudebeast> chris please change it to "especially porno"
[1:26:53] <alejandroid69> get some porno on there baby
[1:26:53] <CoolHand_Sean> now that is an idea

[1:27:09] <Land_Phil> like webcams or whatever
[1:27:12] <DoogieHowserSpankedMySon> it could not work for a guy like me that does not know what porno is and even if i did know what porno was i would definitely need more than a quick bite
