[0:01:03] <sawks> !bundt
[0:01:04] <Nightbot> I bought a bundt cake for Jesse about a month ago. When I brought it home, he got irritated because he has been trying to eat healthier. So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today.
[0:01:10] <Nightbot> Jesse loves eating his own crap. He loves crapping into his mouth. He lays on his back and craps into the air and the crap falls into his mouth.
