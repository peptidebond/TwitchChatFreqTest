[0:38:42] <lord_googoo> Utz for my mid-atlantic friends
[0:38:45] <farthammer1> @springbreakmyheart they are like if you took a spicy chip and rolled it up then fried it
[0:38:45] <emmettfoss> Might call this one a hot take but flamin hot Cheetos are bad
[0:38:46] <coolermaster88> Herr's
[0:38:47] <cosmocat69> Tops generic brand has the best Sour Cream and Onion
[0:38:48] <dipshed> i think lays is the worst whether being flavor specific or not
[0:38:49] <anuscolon> Ruffles All Dressed
[0:38:49] <Land_Phil> i think we can all agree that kettle chips have some fantastic flavors
[0:38:50] <machopineapple> pp
[0:38:51] <dogwontstopnuttingHELP> if Doritos could be replicated without a powdery texture they could be the perfect chip
[0:38:52] <hrkac> lays are great if they nail the flavor they just rarely do
[0:38:53] <carpenter_groot> every pringles type is better that lays
[0:38:54] <twisty6666> if u want a better sour cream and onion u can eat my nutt

[0:39:10] <LilacWhimski> baked cheetos are better than regular cheetos i m o

[0:59:24] <Nightbot> @considerthetetrapod -> Don't say that. [warning]
[0:59:25] <75thTrombone> Does Dril make Mario Maker 2 levels? His Mario Maker 1 levels were dope
[0:59:26] <BigFakeInHell> Wario saying "oh my god!!"
[0:59:27] <75thTrombone> Yes you can
[0:59:29] <dumbguy_69> kingsJesseWin kingsStefanWin kingsJesseWin kingsStefanWin kingsJesseWin kingsStefanWin
[0:59:32] <party_bread> you can i think
[0:59:33] <75thTrombone> Go to a level and there's a "Play Together" button
[0:59:35] <spennyspennyspenny> there is not way to pick a level. the online in this game is unbelieavbly bad
[0:59:39] <Source_Force> there might be a way, in the level select screen there was a tab uptop for other options
[0:59:44] <Hunter_S> Woah Nice who's playing as Wigglio?
[0:59:45] <blanketmoop> waluigo in a really short skirt
[0:59:46] <Grundle_Guy> § <- check this shit out
[0:59:47] <estcejai> i think you can only pick a level in single player
[0:59:49] <owlyoop> i want this game
[0:59:49] <itsmikeo> lol
[0:59:49] <Nightbot> that's funny
[0:59:51] <AfroGunsou> lets see a freakin dril level up in here
[0:59:57] <party_bread> jsut a different menu
[1:00:00] <zeroanaphora> I think Deray made a petition to let you choose levels
[1:00:00] <JeeceyFairer> you can pick multiplayer levels
[1:00:16] <bluestraveler666> jesses playing a girl character!!! LOL
[1:00:18] <Grundle_Guy> thanks
[1:00:20] <spennyspennyspenny> keep in mind, this is the same game where you couldn't play with friends for like 6 months after release
[1:00:21] <Emjoria> believe it or not, you can only play multiplayer like this online, i wanted to play with my brother and if you want to do that you have to download each one you want to play individually
[1:00:25] <MikeASchneider> @zeroanaphora finally something useful
[1:00:28] <BigFakeInHell> That clip of Wario saying "oh my god" from one of the N64 Mario Party games would be a fresh alert
[1:00:30] <blanketmoop> @grundle_guy it is cool
[1:00:47] <skungus> cant do this on concrete
[1:00:52] <Grundle_Guy> @BigFakeInHell yeah lol that's a good one
[1:00:53] <matthollidayroad> wow jesse you're getting cut in line
[1:01:05] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:01:06] <Emjoria> i wanted to refund it when I found out but you can't refund digital games on nintendo's store, no exceptions
[1:01:08] <Grundle_Guy> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ-BZKn7Bk8
[1:01:09] <skungus> lol
[1:01:09] <party_bread> this is wild
[1:01:09] <LilStinker> lol
[1:01:10] <EpochError> jesse was playing the tutorial
[1:01:13] <75thTrombone> If you start by going to "Multiplayer" it's random levels. But if you go to a certain level first, there's a "Play Together" button. I thiiink you can make that work
[1:01:16] <guacamolito> Sorey
[1:01:35] <farthammer1> Stefan loves blaming the lag
[1:01:35] <blanketmoop> there's no real baseball now so you are basically on sports center
[1:01:36] <75thTrombone> I could be wrong
[1:01:43] <JeeceyFairer> i like how stefans mic only cuts out when hes giving useful advice
[1:01:48] <AfroGunsou> i bet it has to be a level youve already downloaded though
[1:01:50] <75thTrombone> Nintendo's multiplayer always sucks. They've made this game's mostly tolerable over time though
[1:01:52] <MikeASchneider> @75thTrombone i think that doesnt work online?
[1:01:56] <coolermaster88> lmao
[1:01:57] <Nightbot> lol
[1:02:00] <big__soda> big__soda subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 3 month streak! scrone
[1:02:08] <Nightbot> @BUNCHOFCATS -> Don't say that. [warning]
[1:02:12] <75thTrombone> @MikeASchneider Could be... I thought I had done it before though? I dunno, Nintendo makes it so confusing
[1:02:12] <itsmikeo> s cr one
[1:02:13] <blanketmoop> it's not lag it's joy con drift
[1:02:19] <depitts> this looks hard as hell
[1:02:20] <skungus> lol
[1:02:20] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:02:21] <Hunter_S> Wagglio here we go
[1:02:24] <Down10_> JF, language
[1:02:27] <Source_Force> you are the second biggest SMM2 Stream right now
[1:02:39] <farthammer1> Imagining Stefan tripping on the sidewalk and shidding his pants and he stands up and says "sorry the lag was really bad"
[1:02:43] <LilacWhimski> the difficulty of the levels basically depends upon how many deaths people have trying to clear it
[1:02:43] <skungus> good run
[1:02:45] <Grundle_Guy> lol

[1:22:22] <sharkbutt> this is the kind of elite gaming that makes me tune into the stream
[1:22:33] <hrkac> !adage
[1:22:34] <Nightbot> The other type of star is pure personality, like the wildly funny and inventive comedy stream "Go Off Kings." These types are basically amateur gamers who captivate for reasons that have nothing to do with skilled gaming. Part podcast, part reality show and part friends chilling on the couch, this type of streamer's world is so inviting and fun it sucks you in.
[1:22:36] <considerthetetrapod> jesse isnt used to driving that car cause its not a mini van. which he has 2 of
[1:22:36] <75thTrombone> If someone else kills the last plant you have to stomp on them to be able to clear

[1:30:02] <LilStinker> ????
[1:30:04] <toilet_noise> armpit is clearly the asshole of the arm
[1:30:04] <arcademattchristman> the asshole is the inside of your nose
[1:30:06] <beef__woman> ladies in the chat who shaves pits cmon
[1:30:08] <Aptiman> asshole, armpit, mouth, leg pit, taint all the same
[1:30:12] <dustinforprints> don't know why everyone in this chat has such smelly assholes

[1:32:01] <johntherun06> I was considering it just to make my balls smaller
[1:32:01] <carpenter_groot> you just have to eat more and work out more

[1:32:31] <unitluna> Just open up the ps4 and use a duster can.
[1:32:36] <BaconWake89> Do steroids until you can lactate, youd save money on milk
[1:32:39] <farthammer1> I was one of the few people in my friend group to NOT do steroids in high school and I still have friends who do it to this day they are 100% healthy if you do them right if my wife was cooler she would let me do them. DO STEROIDS JESSE.
[1:32:40] <Chexoid> Deray quoting Assassins Creed like its profound is my favourite one
[1:32:42] <dumbash> I want steroids but my balls would never get hard then
[1:32:47] <eyeonicDJ> low sugar, low sodium, low booze
[1:32:47] <TaintEnthusiast> you guys should have deray blue vest night
[1:32:47] <NugCaleb> copying sucks. too slow.

[2:10:07] <toilet_noise> there are ways to do it
[2:10:07] <warcranium_> there are channels with various fake currencies
[2:10:08] <johntherun06> Jesus Christ Jesse Star
[2:10:09] <one_bad_hamburger> there are bots i think
[2:10:18] <LilStinker> Jake Da Snake does that
[2:10:19] <ARealLifeBear> I've got a cool 150k to blow
[2:10:19] <toilet_noise> i've seen it on hearthstone streams
[2:10:20] <hrkac> not channel points but like, Fake Bot Bux
[2:10:21] <MarsIsWaiting> im on it
[2:10:22] <zednaught> i don't think you can transfer channel points
[2:10:23] <its_doggety> I watcha different stream where they bet on outcomes. I don't think they use channel points though
[2:10:23] <warcranium_> in hearthstone, for example, you can bet on how many arena wins the streamer will get
[2:10:23] <Cornetto_32> when ive bet on other streams its a currency thats NOT twitch channel points
[2:10:24] <Timb0nic> There is probably no way to transfer them
[2:10:26] <Cornetto_32> its in another program
[2:10:27] <Smanchburger> Reamwork makes the reamwork
[2:10:36] <NugCaleb> bet it all on stefan
