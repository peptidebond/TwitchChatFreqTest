[0:35:02] <Nightbot> lol
[0:35:06] <mrjorts> the power hit is not inherently more powerful. you hold to charge up, and release to swing, so you have to time the release at max power.
[0:35:08] <dmchandler> Fred Willard did die, I just googled
[0:35:11] <patheticwill69> 14 hits... gahdamn dude

[0:52:24] <spenceredelstei> @bobricebobrice lol i meant when a batter came up and the camera focused on his balls
[0:52:32] <oldnick42> Write a guide to being a streamer, like Ninja did.

[0:53:20] <KaiSquared> i think you might want to take... at least one pitch ever
[0:53:31] <NugCaleb> lay off those outside pitches jf
[0:53:33] <farthammer1> @KaiSquared yeah
[0:53:35] <slow_biden> wow
[0:53:40] <thiccmoranis> lol yea jesse swings at everything
[0:53:40] <Nightbot> that's funny
[0:53:46] <thiccmoranis> not a modern day player
[0:53:52] <dmagnum91> what are you drinking jf?
[0:53:56] <slow_biden> if you take out all those runs stefan scored, you're winning
[0:54:03] <KaiSquared> stefan since he's going to swing at everything, can you just groove him a couple in the next inning? give the people what they want, some JF bombs
[0:54:07] <dahbelhuezed> jf never seen a pitch he didn't like
[0:54:21] <alteredbeef> Swing away Jesse
[0:54:24] <BloodWorms> weird shape on center field there
[0:54:27] <Land_Phil> @KaiSquared if i wanted to see some jf bombs i would look at his twitter
[0:54:31] <glockaspaniel> nice pitch
[0:54:32] <thiccmoranis> jf has a decent hit tool but unless he learns to be patient he's just gonna be an out machine
[0:54:33] <MarsIsWaiting> damn

[0:55:40] <farthammer1> Power doesn't matter when the pitch is 3 feet inside and low

[0:56:18] <farthammer1> Balls in the dirt who are you Dalton Wilcox?
[0:56:19] <evilcheeba> You gotta wait back on outside pitches, get out in front of inside pitches. You aren't barrelling up the ball
[0:56:23] <bobricebobrice> deadlines quickly approaching and also capacity to string thoughts together at about 15% happy saturday kings
[0:56:27] <mister_snipes_> youre hitting on top of everything
[0:56:28] <patheticwill69> @farthammer1 now that fucking rules
[0:56:29] <BloodWorms> @MarsIsWaiting no then it would be a puddle of diarrhea
[0:56:32] <Eternalmajin> You're hitting it with the center of your swing circle over the ball, so everything goes straight down
[0:56:35] <thiccmoranis> yea jesse just a slap hitter

[1:07:45] <carpenter_groot> @GoOffKings YKS with Squirm was great
[1:07:49] <rodzirvin> Also calling him crazy, so it's def canseco
[1:08:00] <patheticwill69> carloco = crazy taxi
[1:08:25] <bloviated> canseco has the crazy taxi soundtrack stuck in his head always
[1:08:29] <wellhowdypardner> Not a Good Look my dude!
[1:08:35] <Land_Phil> not a great hit, like that machklemore song
[1:08:36] <KaiSquared> good take jf
[1:08:38] <patheticwill69> it cant be
[1:08:39] <KaiSquared> that's not your pitch
[1:08:43] <KaiSquared> look at that
[1:08:48] <thiccmoranis> there we go jesse
[1:08:51] <farthammer1> Nice single
[1:08:53] <Sogetastic> Not a great hit? Are we talking about a popular song that wasn't realy good? (can't think of one atm)
[1:08:54] <thiccmoranis> patience paying off
[1:08:55] <patheticwill69> what are you looking at stefans bank again
[1:09:01] <KaiSquared> @Sogetastic that's great
[1:09:14] <twisty6666> the ad on the right says "action champ" which is fine whatever. but it makes "fish smoothie" even stranger
[1:09:21] <patheticwill69> call them optomologists
[1:09:31] <trash_k1ng> weird coincidence
[1:09:38] <lordbeef> she was in the movie
[1:09:41] <farthammer1> Remember she was in that Mel Gibson talking beaver movie?
[1:09:46] <patheticwill69> thought for sure that was a squirrel
[1:09:47] <DeadDogHuckabee> dregler pants are too tight
[1:09:58] <BloodWorms> yeah it happens
[1:09:58] <farthammer1> Pete Rose
[1:09:58] <slow_biden> yeah
[1:09:59] <thiccmoranis> yes
[1:09:59] <kadath617> sure
[1:10:00] <hug_nicemann> roberto alomar always did
[1:10:01] <rodzirvin> Nick Punto did it all the time
[1:10:02] <Land_Phil> eric hosmer does that all the time
[1:10:05] <scubadoo2188> yeah they do it sometimes
[1:10:06] <thiccmoranis> it happens a lot
[1:10:06] <patheticwill69> yeah in a teen movie
[1:10:06] <0mnivore> happens some times
[1:10:07] <slow_biden> Kenny Lofton would all the time
[1:10:11] <KaiSquared> happens fairly often
[1:10:14] <ThickHank> great neck here
[1:10:15] <Magnarus> Don't make fun of my Gutterson.
[1:10:15] <its_doggety> I've definitely seen people slide head first
[1:10:16] <scubadoo2188> it's actually a bd idea because it's faster to run through it
[1:10:22] <evilcheeba> The only time you slide into first is to avoid a tag after a bad throw
[1:10:22] <faartdvark> man kenny lofton was a fun player
[1:10:30] <slinkyshoots> sliding is slower than running through
[1:10:33] <Land_Phil> yeah sliding slows you down
[1:10:35] <slow_biden> hell yeah Kenny Lofton on the Indians teams was great
[1:10:38] <ChargedNeon> dummy thicc
[1:10:43] <0mnivore> Ideally you would only slide into first to avoid a tag
[1:10:44] <Sport_Watcher_420> it happens but it's not advised.
[1:10:45] <bloviated> they should dissalow running through first
[1:10:46] <Land_Phil> big nye did a thing about it because hes a big mariners fan
[1:10:46] <fnord_prefect> BIG BAT
[1:10:47] <evilcheeba> Sliding to try to beat the throw is just stupid, yet people still do it
[1:10:49] <KaiSquared> he's wise
[1:10:53] <KaiSquared> like the team dad
[1:10:59] <emuland> According to cod warzone sliding speeds you up
[1:11:00] <bloviated> big nye!
[1:11:03] <slow_biden> 1999 ALDS he broke his wrist/hand sliding headfirst into first base. IIRC
[1:11:03] <fetty_qwop> big nye
[1:11:04] <ourfriendZin> just vaguely racist
[1:11:06] <Land_Phil> oh god dammit
[1:11:09] <ThickHank> if you wanna slide you're gonna have to grease up the dirt
[1:11:12] <rodzirvin> He pees on his hands like Moises Alou
[1:11:22] <Nightbot> If you're a sub, come be a little paypiggy on our Discord! crao https://discord.gg/VraKPdv

[1:11:49] <fnord_prefect> He should charge the mound when the pitcher's back is turned.
[1:11:50] <evilcheeba> All you did was make him mad
[1:11:54] <warcranium_> as one does
[1:11:54] <DeadDogHuckabee> dregler is stacked
[1:11:54] <KaiSquared> No to toughen them
[1:11:55] <hug_nicemann> to harden them, because he didnt wear batting gloves
[1:11:59] <KaiSquared> He didn't wear gloves
[1:12:01] <patheticwill69> it heals blisters
[1:12:03] <carpenter_groot> Nick O'Leay from the NFL would do that too
[1:12:07] <fnord_prefect> You can use pee to make leather.
[1:12:08] <its_doggety> i think Tim Kirkjian has said Moises Alou has one of the biggest penises he's ever seen. By a long shot

[1:12:15] <danglepick> jesse pees water fountain style, lays down flat and let's it rip
[1:12:15] <patheticwill69> it dries out the skin
[1:12:18] <patheticwill69> keeps it strong
[1:12:22] <farthammer1> Stefan pees on his balls. Because his weeny is so short.
[1:12:24] <KaiSquared> contact THIS
[1:12:28] <rodzirvin> You pee on your balls cause your prick is small
[1:12:29] <DeadDogHuckabee> Has the same effect on your teeth if you are trying to prevent cavaties
[1:12:30] <KaiSquared> you could say if you hit it out
[1:12:33] <patheticwill69> great for tough hands
[1:12:34] <evilcheeba> I know you we all pee on our balls, right guys?

[1:52:23] <chungyy1> chungyy1 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months!

[1:52:30] <coolermaster88> all star baseball 2000 baby
[1:52:31] <perrymcguire> wayne gretzky's 3D hockey for N64

[1:52:33] <hometownmarkup> call me junior
[1:52:34] <bluestraveler666> mario golf is great
[1:52:35] <faartdvark> raul ibanez was tradeable for anyone in the first ken griffey game on n64
[1:52:38] <supimscott> Is the robot one
[1:52:38] <winzigwinsbig> would always play slugfest on easy and beat teams by like 50 runs
[1:52:41] <stude> had the snes Griffey game and it was excellent
[1:52:42] <rodzirvin> I played Bottom of the 9th on N64
[1:52:46] <coolermaster88> gretzky's 3d hockey 98 i think
[1:52:58] <Mangoblin> the gretzky games were cool cause i remember in one of them you could summon wayne gretzky

[2:21:03] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> at this point whoever wins deserves it
[2:21:03] <scubadoo2188> stefan is going to put up a run here, and then JF will tie it up next inning and it will keep going forever
[2:21:04] <bjork_liker> Did he say get thee out?
[2:21:08] <patheticwill69> part of that was due to stefan beaning like 47 batters
[2:21:11] <Sport_Watcher_420> a classic pitcher's duel
[2:21:15] <theoverluk> the most fucked thing about baseball is the fans have been desynthesized to laughing at "pujoles"
