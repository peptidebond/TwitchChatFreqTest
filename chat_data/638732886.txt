[1:38:51] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:38:52] <beef__woman> Yeah the cops don’t like protests
[1:38:55] <toilet_noise> it was a climate change thing but i think it had a bunch of anti-renewable stuff that was all wrong
[1:38:56] <TaintEnthusiast> I think the problem people had was he was talking about population size, which some people don't like any mention of (no firm opinion here)
[1:39:01] <mrbimboesq> damn beef__woman, im glad youre okay
[1:39:02] <BigFakeInHell> Michael Moore? More like Michael Snore!! Bazinga
[1:39:09] <hensplash> I watched the movie last night
[1:39:20] <Down10_> He predicted Trump winning and everyone on both sides yelled at him about it
[1:39:23] <CurlyW> I wish he would Michael Fewer
[1:39:23] <beef__woman> @mrbimboesq thanks! I’m a big pussy and ran but some people got fucked up
[1:39:25] <cosmocat69> He was 100% right about Trump
[1:39:34] <NugCaleb> i loved Michael Moore in high school

[1:39:50] <nippywiffle> michael bay probably
[1:39:56] <Down10_> I saw Roger & Me in high school and it was eye-opening.
[1:39:56] <andyateacrayon> also right about health care in like 2005
[1:39:58] <hensplash> The movie was fine
[1:40:01] <cosmocat69> He was scary accurate with Trump. And all his movies hold up!
[1:40:02] <Down10_> It's a classic

[1:40:28] <zany_antics> oh I understand
[1:40:29] <bluestraveler666> the best climate change movie is ice age
[1:40:31] <andyateacrayon> bowling for columbine is actually good
[1:40:33] <Down10_> He had a TV show on FOX in the early '90s and it was brilliant. Hardly anyone remembers it

[1:42:20] <farthammer1> The best movies have sex
[1:42:20] <Down10_> They had a "USA is #1" and it was full of statistics like "Texas is #1 in anti-birth control and #1 in teen pregnancies"
[1:42:20] <dmchandler> @Land_Phil that's awesome
[1:42:28] <notkaz> just making a montage of all the sex clips on Amazon prime video

[1:43:04] <warcranium_> #releasethecumcut
[1:43:05] <NugCaleb> seeing the jackass movies in theater are some of the best experiences in my life
[1:43:12] <friggindummy> my theater blurrred it
[1:43:12] <farthammer1> My favorite part of Jackass 3 is when Johnny Knoxville pulls out and busts all over the camera
[1:43:13] <rodzirvin> In theaters I saw the poop hitting the miniature toilet
[1:43:13] <Down10_> FIVE?!?!?!

[1:43:23] <Grundle_Guy> why stefan keep cuttin out
[1:43:24] <barefootandpreg> they blur pubes in survivor
[1:43:27] <CurlyW> maybe it was uncensored in Canada
[1:43:29] <alejandroid69> yeah they blur it
[1:43:30] <cosmocat69> Jackass 3 was the best 3D movies I’ve ever seen
[1:43:33] <CurlyW> but they censored it in th eUS
[1:43:34] <uoenodoe> cool times
[1:43:38] <pizza_suplex> At the movie theater i went to you got free refills of cum with the collectors cup
[1:43:39] <Down10_> Superbad must have been big in Vancouver
[1:43:43] <chrome_chomsky> ive heard of uncensored but cumcensored???
[1:43:43] <NugCaleb> the cum scene was uncensored in NJ lol
[1:43:47] <MyHeroZer0> stefan's mic gets worse as the shows goes on
[1:43:49] <Source_Force> Jackass 2 is too gross
[1:43:50] <thebigragu420> can we watch video of nfl player running 40 and his dick falls out
[1:43:51] <alejandroid69> i think on the dvd its uncensored, theaters in US had a black bar over his mouth
[1:43:52] <BasementHippo> Jackass 3 was by far the most fun I have ever hard in a movie theater
[1:43:54] <carpenter_groot> Stefan hows the computer
[1:43:58] <LilStinker> We even saw the scene w.the guy shoot giant shit out of his ass that was painted green. The streamer is a model and actress by the way
[1:44:03] <Grundle_Guy> maybe the threshold or whatever got changed, happens to my friend a lot
[1:44:11] <Down10_> @BasementHippo that didn't involve a hand job?
[1:44:21] <jakemasterflex> Jackass 3 was the horse cum one?
[1:44:23] <CurlyW> ah like the TV show
[1:44:30] <taylorintext> yes jesse
[1:44:33] <dmchandler> I've seen Preston Lacy in person, and the 2 or so who live in Portland
[1:44:38] <durkuniverse> yeah jackass 2 was horse cum
[1:44:45] <borg412> please put Y tu mamá también on Watch Party with the warning "WARNING: we're jacking off in here."
[1:44:45] <SoundAlerts> mrbimboesq played Gangnam Style for 250 Bits
[1:44:49] <Down10_> "The horse cum one". This is true art
[1:44:59] <carpenter_groot> Dave England is the best
[1:45:02] <jakemasterflex> Which was the porta potty launcher one
[1:45:03] <CurlyW> lol
[1:45:03] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:45:17] <dmchandler> Preston Lacy was wearing a shirt with his own face on it when i saw him
[1:45:19] <alejandroid69> i am 100% sure jackass 2 was the horse cum one
[1:45:20] <Megaspel> how come in audio editing "dry" means like "nothing done to it"
[1:45:21] <CurlyW> my mom thought Y Tu Mama Tambien would be a good choice for a family film
[1:45:22] <Down10_> "Y tu mamá también" is a bummer of a movie, if you look past all the sex scenes
[1:45:22] <jr5cents781> I saw wee man at the DFW airport once he was super chill
[1:45:22] <MikeASchneider> i've never seen any jackass should i just watch the movies or should i try to find the tv show
[1:45:23] <andyateacrayon> oh baby
[1:45:24] <durkuniverse> jackass 2.5 having preston on top of the porta potty has a gorilla smacking toy planes out of the sky
[1:45:24] <MyHeroZer0> god i don't understand the appeal of those movies lol
[1:45:28] <BasementHippo> oooh baby
[1:45:35] <alejandroid69> dave england eats the turd and washes it down with high life for $100
[1:45:38] <CurlyW> never saw a tape get ejected from the VHS faster
[1:45:42] <farthammer1> Me and my friends saw Jackass in the theater and 10 of us killed 3 bottles of Carlo Rossi and then my friend was fingering his girlfriend in the car on the way home and we almost rear-ended someone and his girl fell forward with her jeans around her ankles
[1:45:42] <andyateacrayon> Dave England shitting in the store toilet is the funniest thing ever
[1:45:47] <bjork_liker> These movies sound disgusting
[1:45:48] <mrbimboesq> I thought i was giving jesse power with the sound alert, my bad
[1:45:48] <BigFakeInHell> Every stream alert is gonna be played loud as hell during the Jackass viewing
[1:45:48] <BasementHippo> lol @CurlyW
[1:46:01] <farthammer1> We all laughed
[1:46:03] <Down10_> That's a movie you have to see on opening night. It's not as fun in a half empty theater
[1:46:04] <europeansheep> lmao farthammer
[1:46:04] <Nightbot> lol
[1:46:08] <alejandroid69> dave englund is so fucking funny
[1:46:09] <dmchandler> @MikeASchneider both are great, try the TV show and see if ya like it... the movie is more of it, plus some bigger bits mixed in
[1:46:09] <andyateacrayon> actually the golf air horn sketch makes me die everytime
[1:46:11] <thebigragu420> the champange of beers
[1:46:17] <drewsgoodtweets> @megaspel maybe something to do with reverb? I know heavy reverb is called "wet"

[1:46:32] <coldslaw69> incredible goal
[1:46:36] <faartdvark> had to wait for all those cops to leave my block so i could walk my dog. lobby is full of terrified old white people boarding up our door, all afraid of the cops. FUCK COPS
[1:46:42] <farthammer1> I watched Steve-O standup like 3 years ago and he tells good stories but he is NOT a standup
[1:46:50] <dmchandler> I remember Knoxville being shot with a gun while wearing a bullet proof vest was in Newsweek, back when it was Big Brother videos I think
[1:46:54] <forensic_beedrill> Just tuning in. Comforting to hear the kings talk about Jackass
[1:46:58] <andyateacrayon> ok Stefan, Rob, JF what is the best Jackass sketch in your opinon?
[1:47:00] <Timb0nic> @MikeASchneider I would try to watch some episodes of the show before the movie
[1:47:02] <thebigragu420> ants?
[1:47:06] <CurlyW> Give Steve-O a TED Talk
[1:47:08] <mrbimboesq> thats fucked @faartdvark
[1:47:10] <alejandroid69> jackass 1 credits
[1:47:15] <BasementHippo> Steve-O's documentary about getting sober is really good
[1:47:22] <alejandroid69> wasabi snooters
[1:47:26] <jr5cents781> Is there anywhere good to watch episodes of the Jackass tv show?
[1:47:32] <andyateacrayon> the high five is so good
[1:47:32] <UltraBadDude> the high five is so good
[1:47:39] <carpenter_groot> the bungie port-o-potty is so good
[1:47:40] <farthammer1> Wasabi is from a similar root to Horseradish
[1:47:44] <andyateacrayon> Bam falling down in that one is amazing
[1:47:46] <owlyoop> airplane jet is my fav
[1:47:48] <springbreakmyheart> the birthday boys one on that is funny
[1:47:50] <halfnoodles> I got suspended from middle school for wearing a "jackass" t shirt
[1:47:51] <dmchandler> the Brad Pitt one might be the best non-simple one from the tv show
[1:47:52] <dui_haver> the way Bam hits the ground is perfect
[1:47:55] <halfnoodles> 3 days
[1:47:57] <dmchandler> but stuff like the high five is perfect
[1:47:58] <farthammer1> The best Jackass sketch is on the screen right now
[1:47:58] <Aptiman> the worst 1 for me was when the guy ate all the ingredients for an omelete, then threw them up, cooked them, and ate the omlette
[1:47:58] <hawesome237> You guys talk about this every damn stream lol
[1:48:01] <carpenter_groot> the butter bean one is great too
[1:48:01] <andyateacrayon> the golf air horn is my fav

[1:48:09] <forensic_beedrill> High 5 is the best just for Bam going from vertical to horizontal in exactly one movie frame
[1:48:17] <CurlyW> cup test is probably the hardest i've laughed at anything
[1:48:22] <consistentlystungbywasps> I

[2:01:18] <TheGreatCactusJac> This is incredible content
[2:01:19] <BasementHippo> kingsRobwhat
[2:01:20] <TaintEnthusiast> I feel like you should involve bakoon in this conversation
[2:01:23] <pecotaredux> pee pee
[2:01:27] <dropkickchannel> yeah get oliver in here
[2:01:31] <CurlyW> holey crap
[2:01:33] <blondesdi> if you have a few depressions on your body yoooouuuu might have some holes
[2:01:36] <warcranium_> nu-hol
[2:01:38] <migrainethresher> if you can't jack off with it what's the point of the new hole
[2:01:42] <Megaspel> yeah google "goatse" on image search @panicwearehanginghere
[2:01:45] <cosmocat69> Hole # 8 in the taint
[2:01:46] <thebigragu420> courtney loves ears are burning
[2:01:47] <halfnoodles> Cheer100 armpits are also holes, they are named after a type of hole!
[2:01:48] <perrymcguire> what about the torso hole in krang where krang was
[2:01:51] <cosmocat69> Eight in Taint
[2:01:52] <panicwearehanginghere> Cool thanks
[2:01:53] <Arbear> I am ready for the new hole
[2:01:53] <Megaspel> (doing a prank no one else google goatse)
[2:01:56] <NugCaleb> new hole? what about the old holes?
[2:01:59] <notkaz> the next hole will be the hugh Hefner pussy underneath the balls
[2:02:06] <TaintEnthusiast> it would make your sack look like an ovipositor
[2:02:09] <arcademattchristman> why do they have the long intestine and the short intestine? just make it all one intestine thats really long?
[2:02:10] <panicwearehanginghere> Oh my god! How is he doing that???
[2:02:10] <toilet_noise> i think we need to combine all the holes into one mega-cloaca
[2:02:12] <munt69> jesse
[2:02:13] <BasementHippo> How about if you had to get rid of a hole??
[2:02:15] <future_alpha_male> I'd give myself the matrix plug hole
[2:02:16] <LilStinker> can i just expand existing holes
[2:02:16] <johntherun06> Stefan out here trying the Socratic method on Rob
[2:02:17] <pecotaredux> imagine if you could poop through your hand
[2:02:21] <bigtigg> this one is getting ugly
[2:02:30] <BigFakeInHell> See I was gonna make a joke about how, as a trans woman, getting an additional hole is an eventual goal of mine but Jesus Christ Y'all, What
[2:02:34] <porchcrop> jesus
[2:02:34] <majorleagueyahtzee> second penis
[2:02:35] <chrome_chomsky> why dont they make the whole intestine out of the black box
[2:02:37] <johntherun06> Like a foreskin for your nuts
[2:02:38] <Down10_> Armpit hair is pubic hair
[2:02:40] <scubadoo2188> gotta let your nuts breathe
[2:02:43] <cn_monoxide> Stefan this really sucks
[2:02:45] <goose_chaser> do nipples have holes?
[2:02:50] <NugCaleb> Stefan I never want my nut out
[2:02:53] <swegw8> twisted testicles are real and dangerous
[2:02:55] <C00LlN> stefan wants to turn his scrote into a foreskin for the balls
[2:02:57] <naffologist> stefan using his nut like a magic eight ball
[2:02:59] <Nightbot> If you're a sub, come be a little paypiggy on our Discord! crao https://discord.gg/VraKPdv
[2:03:01] <ekopleks> no thank you
[2:03:10] <walter_brando> This is the dumbest conversation I have ever heard on the GOK
[2:03:18] <migrainethresher> above the genetalia. like a kangaroo pouch
[2:03:21] <taylorintext> very nice
[2:03:22] <coolermaster88> what a goal
[2:03:23] <Source_Force> Mouth, Nostril, Nostril, Ear Ear, Pupil, Pupil, Anus, Urethra, Vagina (if you have one).
[2:03:28] <panicwearehanginghere> the vas defferins hold the nuts in
[2:03:30] <farthammer1> Imagining Rob finds a magic lamp and tells the Genie "Make me barf on my own armpit"
[2:03:31] <NugCaleb> your but will unravel!
[2:03:36] <buttdog69> this is funny
[2:03:39] <buttdog69> ball hole
[2:03:50] <Land_Phil> stefan said butt nuts
[2:03:51] <warcranium_> no promises
[2:03:54] <arcademattchristman> ball hole
[2:03:55] <dwoobo> lol
[2:03:56] <Nightbot> that's funny
[2:03:56] <NugCaleb> your nut will unravel!
[2:03:56] <Aptiman> the ball hole will be the thing that finally ends the go off kings
[2:04:00] <barefootandpreg> belly button is not a hole it's a dent!
[2:04:01] <swegw8> further testing necessary
[2:04:03] <ekopleks> ive just finished running the numbers. theyd fall out
[2:04:03] <farthammer1> What a fucking goal
[2:04:12] <swegw8> nipple holes
[2:04:13] <warcranium_> mouth is a classic hole
[2:04:16] <johntherun06> MOUTH AND BUTTHOLE ARE SAME HOLE
[2:04:16] <arcademattchristman> your nuts have holes in them to release the semen (cum)
[2:04:21] <BasementHippo> the earhole is no more of a hole than the belly button
[2:04:22] <DruidUncle> ears
[2:04:22] <DrOrpheusMD> ears
[2:04:24] <JoeBushDotNet> Single Nostril
[2:04:25] <chrome_chomsky> nose
[2:04:26] <panicwearehanginghere> nose my don't work anyways
[2:04:27] <jamberg> nose
[2:04:28] <zany_antics> nose
[2:04:28] <notkaz> can you still hear without the earhole
[2:04:31] <springbreakmyheart> nose
[2:04:32] <dwoobo> nose
[2:04:35] <coldslaw69> cloaca
[2:04:35] <beef__woman> Nose
[2:04:35] <skungus> nose
[2:04:35] <Source_Force> nose can fuck off
[2:04:36] <Down10_> I love music, I can't lose those holes
[2:04:36] <turpin4prez> disheveled nate silver on tv trying to comprehend the logistics of the balls hole
[2:04:38] <NugCaleb> nose gotta go
[2:04:40] <DrOrpheusMD> become non verbal creatures
[2:04:40] <Down10_> Nose sucks.
[2:04:43] <barefootandpreg> earhole
[2:04:43] <migrainethresher> where do you shit with no butthole
[2:04:44] <WheezTheSnus> nose. you can breath through the mouth
[2:04:44] <DJ_Dylan27> Nose
[2:04:44] <beef__woman> NOSEEEEE
[2:04:45] <toilet_noise> nose
[2:04:45] <sawks> nose but i can still taste stuff
[2:04:46] <RadishGiant> Nipple holes
[2:04:48] <porchcrop> nose
[2:04:48] <beef__woman> I hate the nose
[2:04:48] <swegw8> what happens if you lose your butt
[2:04:51] <DrOrpheusMD> no smell no taste
[2:04:51] <BasementHippo> technically you could still hear even without the holes
[2:04:51] <europeansheep> you cant taste without smell
[2:04:52] <gulpo19> can't spend my life as a mouth breather
[2:04:52] <barefootandpreg> ear infections are the worst
[2:04:54] <kingofgriff> butthole
[2:04:54] <warcranium_> and most of your sense of taste will be lost
[2:04:57] <toilet_noise> my nose holes suck anyway
[2:04:57] <Source_Force> Smell is a part of Flavor
[2:04:59] <uoenodoe> poop
[2:05:02] <barefootandpreg> I love picking my nose!
[2:05:03] <foygus_> sew em all up and lemme just burst
[2:05:04] <andyateacrayon> cant taste either without the nose
[2:05:06] <LannyMcDonald> butthole

[2:05:08] <Down10_> daffodils
[2:05:08] <kingofgriff> just let it burst down there
[2:05:08] <fischlure> belly button hole
[2:05:08] <hectordoink> you d also lose a lot of taste
[2:05:09] <beef__woman> But there are BAD smells too
[2:05:09] <MyHeroZer0> most smells are bad
[2:05:17] <ChuddTruckley> breathing would be more dangerous too
[2:05:17] <warcranium_> balls candle
[2:05:18] <drippedout> i got 4 lacrimal puncta i could get rid of one
[2:05:18] <BigFakeInHell> I'm not tryna breathe out of my mouth at all times
[2:05:18] <springbreakmyheart> most things smell bad. like a clear majority
[2:05:21] <migrainethresher> look like voldomort
[2:05:21] <swegw8> do you just explode if butthole goes
[2:05:23] <bobricebobrice> balsa wood
[2:05:25] <chrome_chomsky> ballsack candle
[2:05:31] <zany_antics> balsa = balls + salsa
[2:05:34] <Source_Force> you can experience taste without your nose, but you can't experience flavor
[2:05:36] <uoenodoe> you still have mouthfeel
[2:05:36] <Fatass_Jackson> hearing
[2:05:37] <egregiousfuqup> @warcranium_ lol
[2:05:44] <goatshead> no cum either
[2:05:46] <BasementHippo> if the butthole goes you have to poop out of your peehole and vice versa
[2:05:53] <MikeASchneider> peeing out my ass would be fine
[2:05:54] <andyateacrayon> the pee pee will come out your ass
[2:05:55] <toilet_noise> i would be ok peeing out the ass
[2:05:56] <NugCaleb> life without shitting would be great but how?
[2:05:56] <notkaz> you're gonna piss out your nose
[2:05:57] <springbreakmyheart> you probably die without a butthole
[2:05:58] <johntherun06> I will train my asshole to expel urine
[2:05:58] <barefootandpreg> Rob loves puking!
[2:06:00] <BreenIsGod> you would sweat pee
[2:06:01] <DrOrpheusMD> form a cloaca I guess
[2:06:02] <Nightbot> Listen to T̶o̶i̶l̶e̶t̶ ̶P̶e̶n̶i̶s̶ Blocked Party and rate it 5 stars for Little Stefan! https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/blocked-party/id1442925390?mt=2
[2:06:06] <arcademattchristman> Pete holmes?
[2:06:09] <barefootandpreg> he'll puke it!
[2:06:10] <foygus_> converting pee into muscle mass
[2:06:10] <ChuddTruckley> reroute it to the anus
[2:06:12] <BigFakeInHell> Can I trade one hole for another, like I remove nostrils but gain armpit holes in exchange
[2:06:14] <swegw8> would rather pee out the ass then poop out my pecker
[2:06:15] <Timb0nic> I think Jesse is wrong
[2:06:18] <chrome_chomsky> but what a day!
[2:06:19] <andyateacrayon> lmao
[2:06:19] <Nightbot> lol
[2:06:27] <warcranium_> lol Tim and Eric 'Our Bodies' on future bodies
[2:06:27] <Nightbot> that's funny
[2:06:30] <NudeTayneCeleryMan> It's how Tycho Brahe died
[2:06:31] <MikeASchneider> lol
[2:06:31] <NugCaleb> piss excretes from your skin
[2:06:36] <LilacWhimski> it would poison you
[2:06:39] <andyateacrayon> lol
[2:06:42] <AfroGunsou> Caulk Up My Peehole
[2:06:44] <kingofgriff> you can still smell blueberry muffins for that one dsy
[2:06:45] <uoenodoe> lol
[2:06:46] <migrainethresher> pee up my caulk hole
[2:06:53] <LilStinker> if you plug your pee hole the pee will jus shoot out the sides
[2:06:54] <oldnick42> This element was really missing from the stream in Rob's absence.
[2:06:56] <barefootandpreg> you don't piss if you're extremely dehydrated
[2:06:56] <chrome_chomsky> cock caulk
[2:06:59] <toilet_noise> you gotta replace one hole with an extra butthole, which is it?
[2:07:05] <farthammer1> If you can't pee you will die because your balls explode
[2:07:08] <majorleagueyahtzee> did rob caulk up his pee hope when belly button was still on the table
[2:07:10] <zany_antics> I guess losing ear holes is just equivalent to being deaf, which plenty of people actually are
[2:07:19] <arcademattchristman> hamball
[2:07:19] <robmward> I would be so@worried that I smelled and I couldnt tell.
[2:07:23] <migrainethresher> humans would advance so much more quicklyif we had cloacas
[2:07:30] <warcranium_> @robmward great point
[2:07:31] <Land_Phil> i would like to keep cumming if possible
