[0:04:57] <Nightbot> The other type of star is pure personality, like the wildly funny and inventive comedy stream "Go Off Kings." These types are basically amateur gamers who captivate for reasons that have nothing to do with skilled gaming. Part podcast, part reality show and part friends chilling on the couch, this type of streamer's world is so inviting and fun it sucks you in.

[0:08:11] <hrkac> Steven: That's pretty much it—when I'm onstage in the throes of emotion, singing. And they're singing every word and nuance back to me. It's like making love. It's a complete sentence. It's a lifetime in a song, if the melody's just right.
[0:08:12] <GoOffKings> @MarsIsWaiting lol

[0:09:11] <hrkac> Steven: My toes are all squished. During an operation, they had to take nerves out. This was in 2002, 2003. I was on so many drugs, and I didn't give them to someone else to hold. I'm in bed, and I start snorting. I got really bummed out and ashamed.

[0:12:31] <Nightbot> I bought a bundt cake for Jesse about a month ago. When I brought it home, he got irritated because he has been trying to eat healthier. So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today.

[0:42:19] <RevRagu> "you can kill that dog" --stefan
[0:42:25] <Down10_> the animations are really cool
[0:42:34] <bizzylarge> it costs $15
[0:42:37] <drpeepeepoopoo> There is so much sliding under/between stuff in this game
[0:42:39] <therudebeast> in punisher mode you get to drive a lifted ford truck and roll coal on some highschoolers
[0:42:44] <its_doggety> he died like a dog
[0:42:48] <bakkooonn> lol
[0:42:48] <Nightbot> that's funny
[0:42:50] <umjammer_danny> punisher mode makes you hit harder but move real slow
[0:42:53] <murph979> you are fucking hacking that dog to bits. sick
[0:42:54] <umjammer_danny> and you can switch freely
[0:42:55] <AfroGunsou> lol
[0:43:02] <bakkooonn> "woops. ive dropped yet another hot dog"
[0:43:09] <yeeeeeeboiiii> punisher mode is when you commit mass murder because you're sad about your wife or whatever
[0:43:13] <LilStinker> massive amounts of hot dog loss at the farrar household
[0:43:19] <AfroGunsou> open that chest jf
[0:43:22] <AfroGunsou> jf nooo
[0:43:23] <bakkooonn> yes
[0:43:25] <MarsIsWaiting> you missed the chest
[0:43:25] <Koes01> if you guard while in punisher mode you'll counterattack and it's very strong
[0:43:26] <shiteveryday> jessie the chest!
[0:43:28] <ButtmasterX> thats why theres 8 hotdogs in pack, but only 6 buns because of the dog getting some for free
[0:43:28] <thiccmoranis> jesse missed a chest
[0:43:28] <lipwipwipwip> lol
[0:43:28] <Down10_> The play action isn't turn-based,
[0:43:29] <zednaught> there's my hp in the corner
[0:43:40] <ARealLifeBear> I mean, it's probably just a potion
[0:43:41] <therudebeast> i can almost see JF's HP (hot pecs)
[0:43:42] <LilStinker> jesse missed a chest
[0:43:44] <bighowellandpossum> yeah we can see your HP in the bottom right. your Hot Puss
[0:43:48] <bakkooonn> lol
[0:43:48] <Nightbot> that's funny
[0:43:50] <Down10_> ha ha
[0:43:55] <Down10_> yes!
[0:43:59] <AfroGunsou> unlike jessie, jesse missed a chest
[0:43:59] <inthehillsthecities> Search the chests!
[0:44:00] <pinesolomon> lol
[0:44:00] <pbostrom> punisher mode makes you drive a jacked up f-150 with the windows blacked out
[0:44:05] <one_bad_hamburger> that would rule
[0:44:06] <bizzylarge> jesse missed a chest? thats not like him (guy loves porno)
[0:44:06] <CoolHand_Sean> sounds easy
[0:44:11] <bakkooonn> or made a series of realistic masks that you put on and take off when you get damage or heal
[0:44:16] <dadm1lk> is cloud a boy or a girl
[0:44:24] <one_bad_hamburger> stefan ill write that business plan lets do it
[0:44:26] <RevRagu> cloud is a twink
[0:44:30] <Down10_> You would need to code it to receive input from the game, somehow
[0:44:33] <lipwipwipwip> cloud is whatever he wants to be
[0:44:36] <therudebeast> what bakoon said but it's a series of more and more damaged yoda masks
[0:44:36] <bakkooonn> oh 100%
[0:44:37] <sawks> did they take out the spa orgy
[0:44:40] <AfroGunsou> jf could pull off a sleeveless turtleneck

[0:44:55] <TaintEnthusiast> sleveless turtleneck and vest
[0:44:56] <Down10_> JF is Clouding

[1:17:14] <slow_biden> "all things considered" doing a lot of heavy lifting there

[1:17:43] <ARealLifeBear> good line
[1:17:44] <mikeydanger67> barrett sounds like robert downey jr in tropic thunder
[1:17:48] <JanceTramiers> i thought final fantasy was like turn based
[1:17:54] <pizza_suplex> Yeah this boss is weirdly hard for a first boss
[1:17:56] <acoolguyishere> go behind it

[1:18:14] <aPerfectUrkel> the weak spot is behind
[1:18:14] <MyHeroZer0> switch to cloud when he's on the platform, does more damage
[1:18:15] <JonesMcPwnz> FF7 Cloud brought to you by AWS
[1:18:15] <slow_biden> he clearly doesn't have room for all of these rockets

[1:19:24] <JanceTramiers> barret is much cooler than cloud because he has a gun hand
[1:19:25] <justin_siddall> Once the barrier is down use Barret to stagger with him
[1:19:29] <M_Go_Dead> attack the field general, that's right shoot peyton manning in his big ass head
[1:19:29] <adaptation23> You’re doing barely any damage in your attacks

[2:03:36] <artdamage> 90 day divorcee
[2:03:41] <scubadoo2188> Stefan's going to give access to Irene's book club now
[2:03:56] <jamberg> there's also "90 days the other way" which is when an american moves to a different country
[2:04:31] <cosmocat69> Catfish is a fun show
[2:04:32] <pbostrom> I think "90 day fiancee" is when they are the fiancee for 90 days, and before the 90 days is before that
[2:04:35] <AnAnonymousCheerer> anon100
[2:04:36] <jamberg> yeah she's like getting conned now too
[2:04:39] <Reaperov> i had Fifa 09 on the nintendo DS

[2:05:35] <ClassicMach> ClassicMach subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! the kings are my three adult sons
[2:05:36] <anniexiety> gilbert gottfried charges the same amount as randy rainbow on cameo
[2:05:41] <0mnivore> I was thinking the same thing Rodzirvin
[2:05:49] <hawesome237> Listening to jesse describe this show is self care
[2:05:57] <AfroGunsou> ahahahahaha
[2:06:17] <jamberg> he's basically spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a chatbot
[2:06:18] <M_Go_Dead> lol
[2:06:18] <krebex> dude that could just be a bot so easily
[2:06:19] <meat_raffle> lmao
[2:06:19] <Nightbot> that's funny

[2:06:22] <MarsIsWaiting> jesus
[2:06:24] <Reaperov> lmao idiot
[2:06:26] <slow_biden> isn't that just a picture?
[2:06:27] <CountAmonteCristo> this is the grimmest thing I've ever heard
[2:06:28] <jamberg> he's pretty rich
[2:06:32] <Smanchburger> probably super poor
[2:06:34] <jamberg> he bragged about being rich in his first episode
[2:06:45] <DaveGrier> gotta be one of the weird brothers of the vegas shooter
[2:06:50] <SNAATE> this sounds extremely depressing
[2:07:05] <LilacWhimski> :(
[2:07:09] <Reaperov> oh man
[2:07:12] <spennyspennyspenny> hope he likes the rv 4x as much as the lady
[2:07:12] <M_Go_Dead> can he at least play sound alerts?
[2:07:15] <buttson> the rv had a bigger fridge than mitch
[2:07:31] <AfroGunsou> lol
[2:07:32] <Nightbot> that's funny
[2:07:32] <Reaperov> lmfaoo

[2:07:42] <lipwipwipwip> lol
[2:07:44] <jamberg> he had a great quote like "yeah, the first timme she blew me off. but the SECOND AND THE THIRD TIME she had a good reason"
[2:07:45] <slow_biden> 4th times the charm!
[2:07:47] <WheezTheSnus> kingsROAST kingsROAST kingsROAST kingsROAST kingsROAST
[2:07:48] <meat_raffle> god damn

[2:07:50] <Chexoid> this sounds normal
[2:07:50] <Reaperov> loser
[2:07:56] <SNAATE> her brother is in right sector
[2:07:56] <AfroGunsou> pizza

[2:08:13] <farthammer1> I have a medical emergency right now - instagram post sucked me off too hard
[2:08:13] <rodzirvin> Fried chicken pizza
[2:08:14] <carpenter_groot> you telling me a shrimo fried this chicken
[2:08:15] <jamberg> happening right now
[2:08:17] <DaveGrier> gotta be either fake or the producers just actively abusing someone
[2:08:31] <ClassicMach> this sounds too sad to be funny
[2:08:33] <rodzirvin> Big Ed has like a condition right?
[2:08:43] <jamberg> he claims he has a skin condition
[2:08:56] <serpentine666> fun
[2:08:56] <jamberg> i think he's just a pampered baby boy who doesn't like to be uncomfortable
[2:09:04] <farthammer1> Am I too edgy if I suggest all these shows are fake
[2:09:06] <dadm1lk> he has that seatbelt guy condition
[2:09:11] <DaveGrier> if only the juggernaut bitch and big ed coexisted
[2:09:15] <jamberg> yeah he's just a small round dude i think
[2:09:26] <TaintEnthusiast> that's gotta be a kick in the teeth for him
[2:09:27] <SNAATE> gotta get him some HGH
[2:09:28] <puzzlemustard> great cele
[2:09:31] <farthammer1> Sorry
[2:09:31] <slow_biden> score? 2-2?
[2:09:35] <rodzirvin> He has the big time tommy shape
[2:09:36] <farthammer1> I hate to be adowner
[2:09:36] <slow_biden> ah, never mind
[2:09:38] <DaveGrier> no he's got a thing called Klippel-Fell
[2:09:41] <TaintEnthusiast> to go from a sexy little rat to what he is no
[2:09:43] <ClassicMach> i may have missed if someone asked this before but are you guys planning on getting Super Mega Baseball 3?
[2:09:46] <dadm1lk> klippel fell
[2:09:48] <jamberg> in one season the crew got like robbed lol
[2:09:49] <gor_gol> Anyone else live in a place that it snowed today?
[2:09:51] <dadm1lk> pick him back up then
[2:09:54] <jamberg> they actually go to these countries and shit happens
[2:09:59] <notkaz> yeah this month
[2:10:01] <JoeBushDotNet> Supposed to be by the end of this month
[2:10:03] <jamberg> but yeah it's also very fake
[2:10:09] <JoeBushDotNet> But they might delay it to May due to COVID
[2:10:10] <ClassicMach> or early next, possibly delayed
[2:10:21] <ClassicMach> 45 but it has a franchise mode
[2:10:24] <AfroGunsou> its $ jf3000

[2:11:30] <rodzirvin> So he does have a spinal condition, that stinks, he better be a piece of shit on the show so I can laugh at him
[2:11:53] <Chexoid> Stefan is like a benign forest sprite who delights in mischief, but is mostly good hearted
[2:11:56] <carpenter_groot> this blue & red kit rules

[2:15:06] <carpenter_groot> JF play drug dealer simulator
[2:15:14] <puzzlemustard> @rodzirvin omg
[2:15:21] <0mnivore> Remember when someone on NEAS asked JJ who the best presidents were and he actually said Nixon?
[2:15:23] <khajimak> ronald regan is bad imo
[2:15:28] <RevRagu> that big funko doesn't look like anything
[2:15:30] <Cornetto_32> I can't believe the jj Abrams Funko Pop didnt win the blocked party contest

[2:15:57] <TheGreatCactusJac> Dr. Phil is about to shoot force lightning
[2:15:58] <gegen_press> he's a sith
[2:15:59] <alansmithee> chroma king
[2:16:01] <RevRagu> thats just what he looks like without makeup
[2:16:03] <farthammer1> Nancy Reagan was a drug addicted whore - something I would say as a joke
[2:16:05] <considerthetetrapod> chroma king
[2:16:05] <markovblanket> lookin like darth sidious
[2:16:07] <thekylesherry> Good GOD
[2:16:08] <tormance> somehow he has black eyes and a bruise on his forehead
[2:16:11] <BloodWorms> he's a star wars hologram
[2:16:11] <its_doggety> he looks like a star wars projection
[2:16:12] <rodzirvin> He didn't do white balance on his camera
[2:16:14] <meat_raffle> choma king?
[2:16:16] <naffologist> looking like gorbachev

[2:16:19] <Ferice1> is he a force ghost
[2:16:19] <SNAATE> didn't have a ring light so he used one of those SAD lights?
[2:16:24] <bussanut_> Paul bearer
[2:16:28] <buttbuttpeeman> collidal silver?
[2:16:36] <tito_dunkberg> it's a glitch in the simulation you guys
[2:16:40] <LilStinker> he just saw something scary
[2:16:43] <RevRagu> don't these people have money to pay people to set their shit up
[2:16:46] <dberent86> It'd be tough to do that if you tried
[2:16:50] <FrogStack> looks like Tom goes to the mayor
[2:16:51] <dberent86> unless he's got a bunch of blue gels
[2:17:00] <farthammer1> He looked into the Arc of the Covenant on live TV
[2:17:02] <rodzirvin> The light is straight in front of him
[2:17:07] <howintensive> dr phil took colloidal silver
[2:17:09] <markovblanket> i've used zoom it doesn't look this shitty
[2:17:17] <tito_dunkberg> it's Doomer Phil
