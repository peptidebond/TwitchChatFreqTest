[0:06:16] <oldnick42> RIP to all of Jesse's enemies.
[0:06:20] <leedo_> once i realized i could interupt him before he attacks it was way easier
[0:06:22] <alteredbeef> Play on easy
[0:06:35] <SpaceGarrett> need to use that flamethrower more often
[0:06:35] <UnfurledRelic> !rip Jesse's enemies
[0:06:36] <Nightbot> RIP seth
[0:06:44] <eboe> my health feeling some kind of way
[0:06:45] <leedo_> jessie time
[0:06:49] <bluestraveler666> jesse is a health freak these days
[0:07:04] <bluestraveler666> hes got whatever the highest hp you can imagine is +1
[0:07:16] <kolbotn> @GoOffKings There's a English goalie who plays in the lower leagues named Charlie Farrar
[0:07:30] <Down10_> no showing off, soldier
[0:07:34] <UnfurledRelic> that's the risk you take stomping
[0:07:36] <eboe> reminds me of life
[0:07:38] <xriehand> This is maybe the most gamer mode I have ever witnessed JF
[0:08:03] <UnfurledRelic> oh damn
[0:08:05] <16mm> Gamer cum
[0:08:07] <eboe> need more cum in doom
[0:08:10] <Bransonowns> this game is gross. i bet the guys who made it were throwing up a ton.
[0:08:15] <Land_Phil> can you use your sword on this guy?
[0:08:18] <therudebeast> let's all pitch in and get jf that d.va chair i saw on twitter earlier
[0:08:22] <arcademattchristman> all of the demons and goblins are Stefans to me
[0:08:29] <durango_caviar> oh hell yeah early stream
[0:08:39] <dontknowwhatsimpmeans> early stream jesse
[0:08:42] <eboe> this guy just went BEAST MODE
[0:08:42] <chormbly> those fellas are rough!
[0:08:48] <MyHeroZer0> super shotgun
[0:08:51] <shampoodler> i feel like i'm watching Ninja
[0:08:52] <craoulence> F no
[0:08:57] <durango_caviar> that shit sucked
[0:08:59] <umjammer_danny> you can blood punch him though
[0:09:01] <therudebeast> i'll buy anything in which the tip must be removed
[0:09:07] <pisshospital> the tyrant fight in about ~10 minutes is even worse
[0:09:10] <leedo_> i think the good players do ballista and then super shotgun on this guy
[0:09:27] <dontknowwhatsimpmeans> I don't eat enough bananas to buy that
[0:09:28] <hrkac> https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bananaloca/banana-loca-a-very-ap-peeling-innovative-kitchen-gadget/
[0:09:29] <Down10_> uhhh, why
[0:09:30] <scrunkbucket> listened to my first YKS today sorry it took me this long
[0:09:31] <howelldawdy> i dunno what it is but i said yes because it sounds fun
[0:09:38] <GhoulSzn22> mharshbarger subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! awwww yeah
[0:09:39] <MarsIsWaiting> i think the banana with pb or nutella would be good
[0:09:40] <durango_caviar> cum
[0:09:42] <craoulence> the straightening is definitely for your benefit, not so they can just manufacture a straight plastic item
[0:09:44] <cosmocat69> It sounds good as hell
[0:09:45] <arcademattchristman> ah right the banana core
[0:09:46] <Down10_> CUMMIES
[0:09:51] <eboe> sounds nasty tbh
[0:09:59] <considerthetetrapod> okay with that thing: wouldnt the banana be exposed to air so it would get yucky kinda fast?
[0:10:01] <umjammer_danny> just dip it
[0:10:05] <MarsIsWaiting> debatable
[0:10:08] <craoulence> "open the banana"
[0:10:14] <Down10_> That is a pre-coronavirus creation
[0:10:17] <BloodWorms> damn i've heard of a banana cream pie, but a banana creampie???
[0:10:18] <UnfurledRelic> just make a dang banana boat
[0:10:18] <considerthetetrapod> unlock the banana
[0:10:18] <LaOwlLOL> open banana
[0:10:19] <enchantedsaltlamp> Hear me out, banana locaed, with marshmallows and chocolate chips. Wrap that baby up in tinfoil. Pop it in the campfire. Sounds good to me.
[0:10:25] <Land_Phil> go banana (ralph wiggum)
[0:10:28] <Dealeylama> No offense to your gamer skill intended but theres no way you’re finishing this game in 40 minutes
[0:10:28] <ya_boi_moes> Wait slow down, what was that recipe?
[0:10:31] <UnfurledRelic> @enchantedsaltlamp yessir
[0:10:32] <hrkac> ugh god just watched the video and got grossed out at her ejecting the core
[0:10:33] <andclavin> but the banana loca puts the peanut butter inside
[0:10:42] <bobricebobrice> sup king
[0:10:45] <craoulence> it's also for people who somehow think the middle of a banana is gross
[0:10:54] <LaOwlLOL> hold up let me open this orange
[0:10:57] <umjammer_danny> jesse don't play that
[0:11:03] <hrkac> also makes me think of sticking a popsicle stick in my dickhole
[0:11:07] <UnfurledRelic> how much does the banana loca cost
[0:11:12] <andclavin> some freaks are going to use the banana loca for sounding
[0:11:18] <pisshospital> jesse you could be better at this game
[0:11:19] <cosmocat69> Lower right hand corner
[0:11:19] <considerthetetrapod> how much do a banana cost
[0:11:28] <slow_biden> is Kid Chaos the final boss?
[0:11:31] <MarsIsWaiting> Banana Loca is $20
[0:11:32] <LaOwlLOL> banana pretty cheap
[0:11:46] <puzzlemustard> @slow_biden lmao
[0:11:49] <chormbly> wonder if BFG gibs him
[0:11:53] <Land_Phil> noooooo
[0:11:56] <considerthetetrapod> bananas may be cheap, but apples are damn expensive (tech joke)
[0:11:56] <shampoodler> :(
[0:11:59] <sark___> bring back kid chaos
[0:12:03] <chormbly> :O
[0:12:06] <SoundAlerts> leedo_ played Chris NOOOOOO for 100 Bits
[0:12:10] <eboe> Big Flipping Gun
[0:12:14] <Dealeylama> It can under some circumstances
[0:12:15] <SpaceGarrett> you can gib him with it but you have to time it perfectly
[0:12:19] <puzzlemustard> watched the kid chaos vod earlier and just about lost my marbles
[0:12:30] <bloviated> I think the kid thought Jesse was like a pro character creator or something from the stream title
[0:12:31] <enchantedsaltlamp> Went to bed thinking about kid chaos
[0:12:34] <considerthetetrapod> BFG? Banana Filling Gear? Are we talking about the banana loca?
[0:12:37] <Dealeylama> I think you have to shoot the bfg behind him some way
[0:12:46] <UnfurledRelic> I'm houston
[0:12:49] <slow_biden> in a way, we are all kid chaos

[0:20:38] <Ohboymb> thank you everyone
[0:20:40] <therudebeast> i just watched strangelove again for the 1000th time and my favorite line in that film is "shoot! with the gun! that's what the bullets are for!"
[0:20:41] <columbustheatre> why are there so many demons in hell
[0:20:44] <wellhowdypardner> @eyeonicDJ idk, SuperHell?

[0:27:42] <Land_Phil> favorite jar of paste? gotta go with elmers
[0:27:46] <UnfurledRelic> my go-to noodle sauce is lao gan ma mixed with sweet soy sauce
[0:27:46] <dumbash> Gojuchang is good
[0:27:46] <MitchHeep> we talking the paste? or like a premade sauce?
[0:27:53] <goodatsports69> it's pretty chunky but has a watery outer core

[1:02:24] <therudebeast> badlands vs joey would be a much better matchup
[1:02:26] <Down10_> The Matrix sort of copied Dark City
[1:02:29] <BroPair> you tellin me a repo man this movie
[1:02:33] <DrOrpheusMD> the matrix is an amalgam of many pop culture references
[1:02:43] <considerthetetrapod> badlands would destroy Joey

[1:03:06] <buttdog69> The matrix is an anagram of Tixram
[1:03:09] <therudebeast> i'm thinking about badlands sitting on joey and joey is making a woowoowoo in pain and i am smiling broadly
[1:03:15] <robertforry> never heard of it
[1:03:16] <man_brother> Dark City rocks, and the specific theme of the matrix (underlying reality is construct) is done much better in dark city

[2:05:12] <BroPair> jesse putting hot chips in the money in the bank briefcase
[2:05:17] <LilacWhimski> JF is 84 overall and Stefan is 100? interesting
[2:05:19] <therudebeast> i feel like JF's wrestler character could probably beat some real wrestlers, and if stefan's wrestler character was in the ring he would leave in a body bag
[2:05:19] <abyssal1010> lmao Jesse's pose
[2:05:20] <Nightbot> lol
[2:05:23] <notkaz> lol why did Stefan make himself 100 overall and jf 84

[2:08:31] <TaintEnthusiast> kpop fans seem legitimately stupid
[2:08:35] <bogenbroom> This is a greatest hit
[2:08:42] <Down10_> Kpop is trash
[2:08:45] <therudebeast> i am 90% sure that stefan moved a "bulge" slider to the right when making JF's character
[2:08:49] <executivelazers> twice is genuinely good
[2:08:58] <executivelazers> and not just bc I want to smooch jihyo
[2:09:01] <serpentine666> lol
[2:09:03] <Down10_> You don't need taste to enjoy Kpop. It's made for children

[2:09:29] <therudebeast> @warcranium_ dark side is very good
[2:09:30] <wwardlaw> That's Stefan's one weakness
[2:09:36] <chrome_chomsky> just suffocating lil stefan
[2:09:37] <serpentine666> you have to beat the game first to unlock "new jack mode"
[2:09:42] <farthammer1> Hi everyone! You and my wife are my only friends. The enemy is everyone else. Who is everyone else? They are legion. They are everywhere. They are my two children and they must be stopped.

[2:10:00] <bogenbroom> Stefan moves like a fast bug
[2:10:10] <Timb0nic> @gooffkings Jesse here’s a tip. Press Y to reverse moves right before he hits you or grapples you and sometimes during the move. The yellow bar is the number of reversals you have
[2:10:10] <notkaz> the fans are not enjoying this match
[2:10:13] <therudebeast> i want DB to be the ref so much it hurts
[2:10:19] <scrunkbucket> wait! who's this heading to the ring? oh my god... it's DB!
[2:10:19] <VaughnKleeber> Striking blow!
[2:10:20] <therudebeast> can you customize the ref?
[2:10:23] <robertforry> you need to change the movesets haha
[2:10:26] <warcranium_> do you have to hold a direction while pushing the button?

[2:32:58] <steakabuns> how shitty is this game
[2:33:05] <slow_biden> I hope the grinch falls into the ring somehow
[2:33:12] <steakabuns> that's awesome, exactly what i hoped
[2:33:14] <GolfWatcher99> im telling you. this is a 1:1 creation of JF/Stefan cage match
[2:33:15] <danisabol> Holy shit lol
[2:33:20] <Cornetto_32> jesses worst game on stream is world of warcraft
[2:33:22] <notkaz> the bin laden games did not seem good
[2:33:24] <zany_antics> what other game was worse?
[2:33:24] <h_dub_v_lit> Jesse the body Farrar is genius to whoever said that
[2:33:27] <hexproofusername> Yes grinch from the rafters
[2:33:28] <CDBreakfast> even metal detector simulator ?
[2:33:37] <Down10_> This is a game where half the dev team did a great job and the other half fucked around
[2:33:40] <h_dub_v_lit> Lol
[2:33:40] <Nightbot> that's funny
[2:33:40] <lipwipwipwip> little nicky was worse
[2:33:40] <steakabuns> this is the game WWE hired another company to make after the developer who'd made these for 15 years pulled out
[2:33:42] <mdoge> Crowd hating every minute of this
[2:33:44] <zany_antics> metal detector simulator rocked lol
[2:33:50] <bjork_liker> What's that game where you could poop on each other, @gooffkings
[2:33:50] <farthammer1> Jesse's favorite game was Conan
[2:33:52] <Aptiman> i forgot all about metal detector
[2:33:54] <scrunkbucket> first stream i ever watched was Woodwork Simulator. arguably better made than this game
[2:33:58] <tacobellass> this is the best
[2:33:59] <Cornetto_32> yes jesse loved conan and wow
[2:34:10] <zany_antics> oh shit I forgot about woodwork simulator

[2:34:29] <Killertableleg> crashing through the floor
[2:34:31] <zany_antics> what was the one where one player was a dad trying to kill the other player who was a baby
[2:34:31] <GolfWatcher99> *climbs down carefully*
[2:34:31] <notkaz> stefan is dead
[2:34:32] <Down10_> it had real nazi shit in it. cursed game
[2:34:32] <europeansheep> the one where you were a sniper trying to find the other player was bad
[2:34:34] <eboe> the famous saying "10th time the charm"
[2:34:35] <colonelfarva> that's the wall up there brother!!!
[2:34:35] <purrybookchin> kingsYoda_SG
[2:34:47] <wadeboggs_carpetworld> could the climbing down be any more awkward and stilted?
[2:34:52] <batmangioni> WCW on N64 was better than this
[2:34:57] <lil_pookie_c> Stefan liking the abuse
[2:35:02] <patbicks> Troubling left-arm pain
[2:35:02] <slow_biden> DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY ICYHOT?
[2:35:04] <h_dub_v_lit> How do they have Stefan get back up? He's clearly died

[2:35:09] <wellhowdypardner> how do you win this match
[2:35:13] <executivelazers> lol
[2:35:17] <chrome_chomsky> splayed him out
[2:35:19] <steakabuns> it's not like these games were amazing before 2K20 so it's absurd how bad this one is
[2:35:25] <Down10_> get his ass, JF
[2:35:25] <BloodWorms> you hammered him into the ground like a looney tune
[2:35:35] <slow_biden> clip that

[2:35:55] <warcranium_> you can't recreate the classic spot jumping off the cell through the announce table??
[2:35:58] <h_dub_v_lit> @socialistwaluigi lmao
[2:35:58] <Down10_> This game should be fun as fuck! What a disappointment
[2:36:03] <tolks11> this game is the worst
[2:36:06] <teamsolomarx> wwf no mercy
[2:36:06] <nebulakrab> smackdown vs raw was fun on ps2
[2:36:07] <buttbuttpeeman> put Stefan on table. climb cage. jump onto Stefan
[2:36:07] <sixbynine> i can't believe how much this game sucks
[2:36:08] <eboe> wwe good
[2:36:14] <SocialistWaluigi> @steakabuns truth - WM2000 and No Mercy were great, even WCW NWO Revenge was great
[2:36:15] <GhoulSzn22> WCW NWO Nitro forever
[2:36:15] <steakabuns> how have they not just stolen the no mercy control scheme
[2:36:16] <eboe> that was a little joke

[2:45:19] <tacobellass> WET SONIC
[2:45:22] <considerthetetrapod> kingsROAST_EB
[2:45:23] <pigbart91> i think the noid would beat sonic he has a weakness for junkfood

[2:46:18] <anniexiety> i miss rob remember when he drew perfect noid
[2:46:20] <teamsolomarx> now THIS is pro wrestling
[2:46:21] <steakabuns> classic wrestling
[2:46:22] <considerthetetrapod> the noid made that guy take those hostages he's a very powerful being
[2:46:25] <official_genius> the noid rocks
[2:46:27] <tjborg> it's like if WWE was fetish
[2:46:36] <warcranium_> this just gave me a flashback to Mother Goose Rock 'n Rhyme
[2:46:37] <steakabuns> whoever made this sonic was lazy
[2:46:49] <teamsolomarx> dude the noid deserves the belt
[2:46:49] <jon_psimer> Realizing now that Knuckles was a straight rip off of The Noid
[2:46:53] <slow_biden> AVOID HIM
[2:46:55] <lil_pookie_c> whammy!
[2:46:59] <eboe> the crowd needs to be louder
[2:46:59] <Reaperov> the noid is superhuman
[2:47:01] <Mangoblin> surely speed is the one advantage sonic would have over the noid
[2:47:02] <eboe> takes me out of it
[2:47:02] <GlassRadish> lol

[2:47:21] <teamsolomarx> everytime sonic gets suplexed a bunch of rings need to fly out
[2:47:23] <warcranium_> that's the technical wrestling sonic is known for
[2:47:24] <GlassRadish> it's true
[2:47:27] <BloodWorms> the noid could get it
[2:47:27] <slow_biden> Sonic using his knuckles
[2:47:34] <uoenodoe> lol
[2:47:36] <CDBreakfast> sonics in a half shell

[2:47:51] <therudebeast> remember when sonic went heel in the mid 90's
[2:47:53] <cosmocat69> Sonic V Noid: Dawn of Justice
[2:47:55] <considerthetetrapod> the noid cums mozzarella

[2:59:20] <eyeonicDJ> you play in your own maps and the inputs are the same and if one game glitches, it cant stay synced
[2:59:23] <Cornetto_32> jesse vs ynb fight!!!
[2:59:24] <lord_googoo> YNB, JF's BFF
[2:59:29] <robertforry> dash and then yb like mortal kombat

[2:59:49] <lil_pookie_c> Noid has broken like 90% of his bones by this point
[2:59:55] <eyeonicDJ> its impossible to resync
[3:00:00] <Cornetto_32> you should walk into a corner for a while to sync up
[3:00:03] <oldnick42> Could you walk to the extreme corner of the map in both games, and re-sync that way?
[3:00:10] <eyeonicDJ> well really un possible
[3:00:11] <lord_googoo> wow they released this lmao

[3:01:10] <serpentine666> wtf
[3:01:14] <GlassRadish> the crowd begging for this to end but Sonic doesn't care

[3:12:44] <robertforry> MY HERO
[3:12:45] <midwaymonstertx> this should be on espn
[3:12:51] <artdamage> THE UNSEEN DANGER
[3:12:53] <chrome_chomsky> the crowd in jeesse's universe booing him just walking around
[3:12:56] <smoothw1> WHO IS THE DREAMER
[3:12:57] <lil_pookie_c> Rolling on the floor dying
[3:12:58] <slow_biden> is it going to go back to JF's screen after the pin?
[3:13:11] <RudeAndCheap> Lmao no one is gonna remember JF beating Doom.
[3:13:12] <Nightbot> lol
[3:13:20] <jazzisking> 3.5 stars
[3:13:29] <M_Go_Dead> sonic just punching empty air in jesse's game si pretty bad ass
[3:13:29] <robertforry> he likes punching
[3:13:34] <buttdog69> DDT Fest 2
[3:13:37] <midwaymonstertx> people in sonics universe have just been wathching him punching air for 20 minutes
[3:13:40] <robertforry> sonic is a notorious puncher
[3:13:40] <freedeweezy> the crowd loves it
[3:13:42] <warcranium_> this should have been the 4/20 stream
[3:13:42] <BloodWorms> WHERE THE BIG BOYS PLAY
[3:13:42] <GlassRadish> the crowd is too scared to ask what Sonic is doing
[3:13:43] <fiscaltwinkie> having a full breakdown in front of the crowd
[3:13:43] <robertforry> haha
[3:13:44] <pickle_army187> this game was made by the creators of the obama care website
[3:13:46] <notkaz> this is a 10 star match
[3:13:48] <robertforry> in 2 dimensions
[3:13:48] <lil_pookie_c> sonic is like elizabeth moss in invisible man
[3:13:48] <early90spants> shoulda done it in the tokyo dome
[3:13:49] <wadeboggs_carpetworld> omega-okada sucks compared to this
[3:13:50] <pen16club> seven stars between them
[3:13:51] <Aptiman> this is the plot of DEVS
[3:13:51] <NYC_TatiB101> assbalMYSTERYMAN
[3:13:54] <ApollOrc> drugs!\
[3:13:54] <oldnick42> This feels like a Robotnik scheme to me.
[3:13:55] <GhoulSzn22> ricker morton
[3:13:56] <spenceredelstei> technically since it's 2 fights you have 7 stars
[3:13:56] <McCainFlightSchool> theyd be a pickle
[3:13:59] <itsmikeo> theyd turn into a freakin pickle
[3:13:59] <GlassRadish> uh they'd be like "I'm Pickle Rick"
[3:14:04] <zany_antics> the bra would be voiced by Kumail Nanjiani
[3:14:08] <hug_nicemann> this is like the jake roberts/rick martel blindfold match
[3:14:09] <lord_googoo> Ricky morey
[3:14:10] <artdamage> you made me a shadowboxer baby
[3:14:10] <durkuniverse> spot on jf
[3:14:11] <Heck426> dave meltzer loves this match 5 stars

[3:15:02] <warcranium_> Snickers purchased in-game ads for this
[3:15:04] <GlassRadish> show no mercy, Sonic
[3:15:07] <pen16club> Does the noid still exist in Jesse's dimension?
[3:15:10] <lil_pookie_c> the greatest of all time poster is how I feel about this stream
[3:15:12] <lord_googoo> I'm Pikin Rick
[3:15:12] <BloodWorms> Jesse is trapped in the big boy dimension

[3:16:49] <lil_pookie_c> hey, that's my preferred sex position
[3:16:50] <GhoulSzn22> he tapped!!!
[3:16:50] <tjborg> In JF's reality everyone is booing him
[3:16:50] <thatszaaack> is this quantum computing
[3:16:51] <umjammer_danny> player*
[3:16:58] <listenerdave> "what are days"

[3:17:13] <ApollOrc> lol
[3:17:14] <Nightbot> that's funny
[3:17:19] <robertforry> this is what happens when you die
[3:17:20] <starkimified> Is it actually possible to end this match?
[3:17:20] <smoovebwain> this is the ideal GoK game imo
[3:17:21] <artdamage> the ref didnt see sonic tap because hes too busy watching sonic punch air
[3:17:29] <the___community> security debating what to do with sonic
[3:17:36] <mdoge> Quantum entanglement in action
[3:17:41] <listenerdave> it felt nice to see that they were playing it
[3:17:47] <tarvaris69> Are the fans stuck in both dimensions?

[3:18:20] <RevRagu> i sure could go for a snickers
[3:18:25] <official_genius> the noid should try doing a SNICKERS FINISHING MOVE
[3:18:25] <robertforry> how can you not throw people off the cage on purpose but you can accidentally fall off?
[3:18:29] <jazzisking> Really wish Chris was here to see this
[3:18:30] <slow_biden> man, Kid Choas doesn't fuck around. look what he did
