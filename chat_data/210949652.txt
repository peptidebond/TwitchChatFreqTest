[0:11:18] <umjammer_danny> fuck original
[0:11:22] <hometownmarkup> bbq is best
[0:11:27] <TechIssueLiar> the thing you have to respect about pringles is that they're always trying new things
[0:11:28] <love_too_watch_games> Hi Asuka!
[0:11:31] <fathertiresias> you can never get over mono
[0:11:33] <ShooterMart> From kissing the mic
[0:11:35] <llibja> who did u kiss
[0:11:38] <pirate8> good one stefan
[0:11:44] <Strahd_> jeese please i want you inside me (both ears)
[0:11:51] <considerthetetrapod> can we get coverage of the video game awards please boys
[0:11:56] <umjammer_danny> I missed a whole semester of high school when I had mono
[0:11:58] <YKSFAN> Tork
[0:12:00] <doubledarkhorse> what kind of mic is jesse using?
[0:12:14] <IncestKevin> poured half a bottle of wine on the carpet
[0:12:16] <Strahd_> It's a left channel only mic, doubledarkhorse
[0:12:19] <biggest_fans> The paper towel dispenser is great when it acts as a rimshot to a joke.
[0:12:20] <YKSFAN> Jesse is Alvin Kamara going to be ok?
[0:12:23] <d_o_n_n_y_> i really love just how annoying the subscription sound is
[0:12:31] <umjammer_danny> wow
[0:12:45] <tenderstems> Rob give me pringle
[0:12:48] <ihav4gotn> swiftrage100 pay 2 win, buying packs. BAD GAMER
[0:12:50] <Strahd_> #TeamAluminum
[0:13:02] <munt69> can check
[0:13:06] <dropkickchannel> the first card he opens is the worst spell in the game, nice
[0:13:15] <pvtBoolean> stefan's mic is cutting again
[0:13:19] <garyoussy> summon an animal companion, that's when stefan tells jesse it's time to gamer stream
[0:13:23] <umjammer_danny> what were they thinking
[0:13:27] <chexferguson> pregnant marmaduke
[0:13:28] <ShooterMart> Please can Stefan sort his microphone drop outs? This is below the level of professionalism I expect from the stream
[0:13:30] <Boomhauer1988> i've got my headphones tied to my ceiling fan rotating above my head so i can hear jf in stereo
[0:13:38] <IncestKevin> is this the Splatoon game?
[0:13:40] <glockaspaniel> can we get another soundbit of jesse saying "i payed for this with my gold"
[0:13:40] <Strahd_> I used my last Prime Sub on LanaDelRayathon but I'm switching to you because you haven't accused of sexual harrasment (yet)
[0:13:40] <MizoGUCCI> i don't know how this game works but that sounds dumb as shit
[0:13:47] <oxinspector> stefan or jesse, would you care to comment on the death of canadian icon august ames?
[0:13:50] <123balls_> You guys should play the star trek game for a stream
[0:14:03] <ButtstuffGuy> just came in has jesse opened any legendaries yet?
[0:14:11] <pvtBoolean> rather than fixing jf's audio coming out of the left only you should make it so stefan and rob only come out of the right so it's like we're sitting between them on a couch
[0:14:14] <jt60564> bring back the "jesse has hiv and aids" message
[0:14:21] <Strahd_> JESSE I NEED YOU IN MY RIGHT EAR
[0:14:24] <d_o_n_n_y_> the august ames death isnt funny, she committed suicide :(
[0:14:29] <Kevinski> !uptime

[0:14:46] <jakerwvu> buying stock in the gamer stream
[0:14:46] <Boomhauer1988> strahd, wear your headphones at 90 degrees and all the way up.... forehead and back of the head
[0:14:48] <DrBabydick> maybe give Jesse another mic
[0:14:53] <Rolyatkcinmai> switching my PC's audio to be mono so that I can get Jesse in every orifice
[0:14:59] <IncestKevin> she had information that would lead to the arrest of hillary clinton
[0:15:07] <Strahd_> Tough but fair, Windows
[0:15:13] <TechIssueLiar> it's only doing one channel because you're only wearing one set of headphones
[0:15:18] <Sinesthetic> it's funny how you're talking about ms ames - I was just JOing (tho' not with August)

[0:33:49] <Strahd_> Jesse you need to replace that left channel mic with one with one that has both the channels

[1:15:26] <John_Olerud_> RIP Greg Kinnear. gone too soon.
[1:15:26] <ShooterMart> The real present Rob got for his Birthday, was Jesse's fine comedy
[1:15:42] <glockaspaniel> that dinner look hearty rob
[1:15:51] <eatmorekale> plastic is great for the environment
[1:15:56] <C00LlN> If Mark Zuckerberg died and they just had to reboot him and then he was normal that would rule
[1:15:56] <swappingspit> 50 years young
[1:15:57] <prof_hardcastle> He's had that plastic fork since his 20's.
[1:15:58] <claytondeth> Is rob eating cake?
[1:15:59] <umjammer_danny> that song has a line about sailor moon being an anime babe that I never heard when I was younger
[1:16:04] <yarightdude> When you're in Stefan And Jesse

[1:16:09] <LRonFrancis> Steve Harwell.

[1:16:21] <hometownmarkup> plastics make it possible
[1:16:27] <dh2121> since its rob birthday i wont say that he is gonna accidentally kill the cat with hugs
[1:16:28] <claytondeth> Rob is eating his wife and kids
[1:16:30] <rouyou> its organic causr its made of csrbon
[1:16:30] <WillieNorthpole> stefan and rob went back to college and now stream from their dorm room
[1:16:32] <Kevinski> Plastic actually filters the oceans
[1:16:42] <Pernero> We need a family circus podcast
[1:16:43] <glockaspaniel> stefan are you using the samsung galaxy cardback?
[1:16:46] <springconvert> Stefan’s ass is on the ground
[1:16:51] <d_o_n_n_y_> rob i dont know if you saw it earlier but you were very good on the latest RGS premium ep
[1:17:00] <MindOfMenciaDVD> it is with the heaviest of hearts that we announce the passing of Gary Larson
[1:17:01] <Dumper> IF plastic was bad the oceans would get rid of it
[1:17:12] <love_too_watch_games> Good let’s talk about the environment that won’t give me a panic attack
[1:17:14] <goat_attack> omg asuka
[1:17:22] <ReneBork> asuka stealing the show

[1:17:56] <eatmorekale> jesse should do dungeon runs since he's pretty familiar with dealing with runs
[1:17:58] <ShooterMart> At least you have your work together on cafe.com Jesse
[1:18:04] <mikeisasnack> santa claus dead at 58
[1:18:13] <ariebigdaddy> they burn popcorn in the microwave when they blaze in the dorm room
[1:18:20] <claytondeth> That’s why stefan was doing push-ups last time
[1:18:24] <hometownmarkup> and make sure to support him on patreon
[1:18:26] <springconvert> And exhale through a cardboard tube filled with dryer sheets
[1:18:27] <WillieNorthpole> the RA stops by sometimes to pour out their piss bottles and scold them

[1:19:41] <garyoussy> hope rob enjoyed a nice no-wiper for his birthday
[1:19:44] <Sinesthetic> jesse farrar 1985-2074: "He loved diarhhoea"
[1:19:56] <rouyou> mid shower pooping???
[1:20:02] <claytondeth> We’re rappin shit, baby
[1:20:07] <glockaspaniel> enjoying "shit-talk with rob and jesse"
[1:20:08] <biggest_fans> You don’t just crap in the shower and stomp it down?
[1:20:19] <davidjn719> you dont need to stomp diarrhea
[1:20:24] <ariebigdaddy> Rob angles his nude ass out of the shower and aims his turds into the Tork
[1:20:25] <hometownmarkup> there's no difference between the 2
[1:20:26] <Clifftaurus> Diarrhea kills literally millions of people every day Jesse.
[1:20:28] <prof_hardcastle> Rob I love me a nice smooth clean dump
[1:20:29] <d_o_n_n_y_> Dear #Avengers, I know Thanos has you all preoccupied, but if you can dispatch a few web-slinging, gamma-irradiated, armor-suited peeps over to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue—we're dealing with our own oddly-colored madman trying to destroy humanity. Thanks. #InfinityWarTrailer
[1:20:33] <Strahd_> I mean you always wipe, but you are surprised when you don't have to go back in for anothe rone
[1:20:36] <DrBabydick> Ingram 3 to take the lead with .8
[1:20:49] <garyoussy> Diarrhea may be a good angle to secure that Tork sponsorship
[1:20:50] <claytondeth> They’re throwing shade

[1:21:19] <pvtBoolean> it's good for your feet
[1:21:21] <Sinesthetic> if it wasn't for plastic, how would longshorefolk spot the gyres?
[1:21:23] <Strahd_> How excited is everyone about Top Chef season 15
[1:21:23] <porkscream> does jesse freeze his turds for later
[1:21:24] <munt69> that's more than fair
[1:21:26] <glockaspaniel> jesse just nutted (used all his cards in his hand)
[1:21:26] <MindOfMenciaDVD> prefer to evacuate my bowel via c-section
[1:21:29] <Dumper> can confirm wafflestomp
[1:21:30] <considerthetetrapod> environmental researcher here: every thing in nature is desperate for that delicious delicious plastic
[1:21:33] <d_o_n_n_y_> one time when i was a freshman a guy took a shit in the dorm floor's study room
[1:21:37] <eatmorekale> gets easier if you unscrew your grate prior to the shower

[1:27:03] <TechIssueLiar> if you add pepper it becomes cacio e pepe which is classier
[1:27:16] <dh2121> who are you saying that to
[1:27:17] <jakerwvu> make sure you bring over mac and cheese
[1:27:18] <mcdonnellpf> mac and cheese and kraft dinner and 2 different things
[1:27:18] <Kevinski> A whole box of Velveta is no problem. Not sure about Craft
[1:27:23] <Strahd_> Kraft Dinner is what canadians call mac n cheese
[1:27:25] <jakerwvu> lmfao
[1:27:28] <glockaspaniel> did stefan just use that fan of knives for the card draw or?
[1:27:31] <dh2121> jesse:"bring mac and cheese over"
[1:27:45] <jakerwvu> "hey man, just make sure you bring over some mac and cheese, aight peace."
[1:27:47] <pvtBoolean> technically kraft dinner is not mac and cheese because it doesn't qualify as cheese
[1:27:47] <biggest_fans> That’s what he says to mike every week.
[1:27:49] <yarightdude> More like whack and jeez
[1:27:57] <Strahd_> It's just sad mac n chee
