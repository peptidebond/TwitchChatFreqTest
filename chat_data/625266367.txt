[0:01:09] <Nightbot> I bought a bundt cake for Jesse about a month ago. When I brought it home, he got irritated because he has been trying to eat healthier. So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today.

[0:26:45] <cascadian87> loved reboot

[0:26:51] <johntherun06> @nugcaleb Choked on her dads dick, RIP
[0:26:52] <bjork_liker> Loved Reboot
[0:26:53] <oldnick42> I used to watch Reboot all the time.
[0:26:54] <cosmocat69> My favorite Brendan Fraser movie is GI Joe, where he rides up on an ATV, says one line, and then drives off
[0:26:55] <listenerdave> I watched reboot here in the states
[0:26:55] <GooseDerricksoN> Reboot was on in the states
[0:26:56] <Down10_> I think all 3 seasons
[0:27:02] <Number6DogMom> I loved Reboot as a kid
[0:27:09] <listenerdave> it feels kind of belgian, Reboot
[0:27:10] <markfartman> that would've been a sick HR
[0:27:13] <therudebeast> they did a revamped reboot a few years back
[0:27:13] <oldnick42> Reboot is what I thought all of Canada was like.
[0:27:13] <Down10_> I loved that show too.
[0:27:14] <theoriginalferg> there's an awful Reboot remake on Netflix
[0:27:14] <borg412> pretty sure they rebooted reboot
[0:27:17] <johntherun06> They rebooted Reboot, did they not?
[0:27:19] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> Stefan did you ever see Ace Lightning? It was some weird Canadian show that I suddenly remembered the other day
[0:27:24] <brgrho> Anybody got a sip count on Stefan?
[0:27:25] <LilacWhimski> they brought it back yeah
[0:27:29] <Number6DogMom> I saw it on network saturday morning tv

[0:27:55] <eyeonicDJ> yea it was fun
[0:27:59] <TheGreatCactusJac> beast wars rocked
[0:28:01] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> It's about characters from a video game that came to life during a lightning storm
[0:28:03] <farthammer1> Everyone on Reboot was rock hard all the time from all the Blue Chews
[0:28:04] <CanadianAdam> Beast Wars was tight

[0:28:17] <tompeppre> they did
[0:28:18] <Land_Phil> beastie boys
[0:28:18] <theoriginalferg> Reboot and Beast Wars had a ton of crossover behind the scenes
[0:28:19] <heavyjob> they did
[0:28:23] <anuscolon> who's pitching. what is happening
[0:28:23] <McCainFlightSchool> that sucks
[0:28:23] <themattymac> beasties!
[0:28:23] <CanadianAdam> the did call it Beasties in Canada because a child's show couldn't have "WAR" in the title

[0:32:54] <GhostofGhostDad> tooth hurty amirite
[0:32:54] <brgrho> The doctor said I was "Boss"
[0:32:57] <Number6DogMom> That hoke oughta be good for half off
[0:32:58] <therudebeast> i am 32 and one of my teeth is a baby tooth, and my dentist has the attitude "well, we'll deal with it if it starts bugging you i guess"
[0:32:59] <SeriousAdult> just go in and let er rip
[0:33:01] <estcejai> Teeth suck ass
[0:33:03] <Ohboymb> they had to knock me out because they had to smash all my fuckin wisdom teeth up to get em out
[0:33:07] <one_bad_hamburger> cmon
[0:33:08] <listenerdave> tooth hurty
[0:33:09] <BloodWorms> that's smart chris
[0:33:11] <McCainFlightSchool> my beanus hurty
[0:33:13] <foygus_> now thats funny
[0:33:13] <KaiSquared> my dad loves tooth hurty
[0:33:17] <Sogetastic> @listenerdave now that's funny
[0:33:17] <theoriginalferg> Mumber8DogMom said hoke
[0:33:19] <rainbows_92> oooooohhhhh
[0:33:21] <kroniton> tht's a classic
[0:33:22] <Nightbot> @considerthetetrapod -> Don't say that. [warning]
[0:33:22] <GooseDerricksoN> Beanus hurty
[0:33:23] <rainbows_92> i get it now
[0:33:26] <DJ_Dylan27> Chris is on fire
[0:33:27] <listenerdave> tooth ten ....the tenth tooth in my mouth
[0:33:36] <one_bad_hamburger> benus thirty
[0:33:37] <brgrho> I think it's because it doesn't make sense to go to the dentist unless your tooth is hurting. So, why would you schedule it at tooth finey?
[0:33:41] <Ohboymb> when my dad brought me home after i got mine out i remember he tried to wrap a blanket around me, and i was like, what the fuck is this for
[0:33:42] <0mnivore> Tooth shit is a nightmare
[0:33:54] <GooseDerricksoN> I used to get migraines from grinding my teeth
[0:33:55] <munt69> I'm getting my whisman teeth out in June
[0:33:57] <MarsIsWaiting> ?
[0:34:00] <eyeonicDJ> teeth shit is so bad
[0:34:04] <farthammer1> That was some toothy defense
[0:34:05] <brgrho> Denture gang stand up.
[0:34:07] <barefootandpreg> my brother calls them my brains
[0:34:08] <depitts> I sleep with a guard every night, you get used to it
[0:34:10] <wwardlaw> Best advice I got was to wear a nightguard. You can't replace enamel once it's gone
[0:34:12] <one_bad_hamburger> lol jf
[0:34:12] <Nightbot> that's funny
[0:34:14] <LilStinker> my little brother grinds through mouthguards . literally tears holes in them in a couple weeks
[0:34:14] <Ohboymb> great anecdote from me above
[0:34:14] <toilet_noise> They used to just take out all your teeth when you turned 21 and give you a set of dentures
[0:34:17] <considerthetetrapod> my dad is the nicest guy but after he woke up from being knocked out for his wisdom teeth, he spit bloody cotton balls at the nurses
[0:34:18] <AfroGunsou> i wear a mouth guard for grinding teeth but i still wake up with a headache from clenching my jaw all night
[0:34:19] <borg412> is it illegal to take a ball in this game?
[0:34:20] <therudebeast> eventually i will be removing all of my teeth and replacing them with pieces of gravel like that guy from TV in the late 90's
[0:34:21] <kolbotn> Rob I used to get severe migraines and a nightguard changed my life
[0:34:21] <Mothagoat> kingsStorm

[0:51:16] <robmward> Bummer Jesse is AI now
[0:51:25] <cosmocat69> Stefan you mentioned Brendon Fraser got blackballed: it was because he got sexually assaulted at the Golden Globes
[0:51:25] <migrainethresher> @WheezTheSnus seriously
[0:51:26] <supimscott> Stefan tell us more about the Eatmore bar I’m fascinated by it
[0:51:29] <therudebeast> encino man is a fine movie, but not fraser's best work
[0:51:29] <chrome_chomsky> jesse had to google what a party looks like
[0:51:33] <farthammer1> Dick Dastardly is killing it in Scoob

[0:52:13] <migrainethresher> if you want current Fraser content, watch Doom Patrol. it is transcendent
[0:52:15] <gegen_press> 5 stars
[0:52:17] <Down10_> Why is the movie called Scoob and not Scooby
[0:52:26] <joeveralls> what is chris's name on steam?
[0:52:26] <ElGoato> Not going to lie, the Eat More looked good on my google search. The pictures look awful, though
[0:52:27] <cosmocat69> Googled the Goatse candy and was grossed out
[0:52:28] <NugCaleb> 5 bags and 2 sodas
[0:52:35] <supimscott> That sounds ok actually
[0:52:35] <therudebeast> the movie is called scoob because it is broadcast in quibi mode
[0:52:43] <chillBuu> jf there's a VR mod for gta5 called real mod
[0:52:44] <DrOrpheusMD> because this is the 1000's scooby doo property
[0:52:45] <Dealeylama> Do they have Caramello bars in canada
[0:52:46] <zednaught> lol i just looked at the cherry blossom candy, that's wild
[0:52:46] <dmchandler> He's always called Scoob by Shaggy
[0:52:46] <Nightbot> that's funny
[0:52:55] <dmchandler> YOIKS, SCOOB he sez
[0:52:59] <GoOffKings> @chillBuu oh sick
[0:53:03] <serpentine666> Scoob for short
[0:53:06] <farthammer1> Chris thought Scooby Doo was a real person
[0:53:06] <Down10_> oh i see
[0:53:08] <Ohboymb> chris that is foolish
[0:53:09] <arcademattchristman> what?
[0:53:12] <egregiousfuqup> Scoob is what Shaggy always calls him
[0:53:12] <chuck420blazer> trevor with the jf glasses
[0:53:13] <AfroGunsou> its called scoob because shaggy is teh focus and he refers to scooby doo as "scoob". probably
[0:53:13] <Timb0nic> Hanna-Barbera are legends
[0:53:17] <therudebeast> is that johnny knoxville on the left?
[0:53:18] <alaskathot> Scoob is a dirty sex word
[0:53:20] <vanapps> lol

[0:53:28] <Down10_> I didn't know Hanna-Barbera was a studio at first either
[0:53:36] <farthammer1> Chris didn't realize Hanna Barbera was a cartoon company and he thought Scooby Doo was a documentary
[0:53:44] <alexmcdonald_age11> The pants are too damn high.
