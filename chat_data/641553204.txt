[0:03:04] <Nightbot> I bought a bundt cake for Jesse about a month ago. When I brought it home, he got irritated because he has been trying to eat healthier. So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today.

[1:27:31] <panicwearehanginghere> I bought the book because i‚Äôm a fan of Jesse‚Äôs from Twitter and stuff, but this really is worthless. It‚Äôs a really lazy attempt to capitalize on his fame from platforms that don‚Äôt make money. I was expecting coachisms like ‚Äúfailing to prepare is preparing to fail‚Äù. But it‚Äôs nothing but stupid old quotes about how field goals work and what blitzes are. There‚Äôs very little content outside of the quotes. Interesting on a minor level, but I could get the same stuff on Google. Which is what Jesse
