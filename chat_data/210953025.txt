[0:39:21] <biggest_fans> It's a literature club
[0:39:23] <claytondeth> It's literature
[0:39:24] <oldnick42> play Nidhogg 2
[0:39:26] <chatbotv2> visual novel
[0:39:27] <UnPocoLoco23> This is the whole game by the way
[0:39:28] <howintensive> cheer1 cheer1 cheer1 great clicking jesse
[0:39:29] <Axault> it's a visual novel not really a game
[0:39:29] <rodzirvin> Dan Johnson loved Minecraft RIP
[0:39:34] <brokik1> This is a visual novel Jesse. it's an absolute slog
[0:39:34] <unitluna> it's a visual novel dummy
[0:39:35] <BroPair> There is a skip button and I've been wondering how long Jesse wouldn't notice it
[0:39:35] <LRonFrancis> more bible games
[0:39:37] <garyoussy> they keep the gameplay simple so it can be played with one hand
[0:39:37] <blerpo> geoguesser is more boring than this actually
[0:39:37] <teamsolomarx> its a visual novel so yeah kinda like a book
[0:39:38] <yespete_> "It's just click"
[0:39:41] <i_Flan> jesse might have fun if he reads it as if he is the girls
[0:39:42] <real_cool_guy> We want to see Jesse move the headboard to see his light switch that's flush to the door frame.
[0:39:44] <dqbert> is this undertale
[0:39:45] <PaxVirtua> hit skip
[0:39:45] <toiletfather> this game stinks worse than my ass
[0:39:50] <springconvert> Jesse is now reading a book on the stream
[0:39:53] <MindOfMenciaDVD> dream daddy
[0:39:54] <blerpo> this game still contains more movement than geoguesser
[0:39:56] <ShooterMart> Mishima Forever
[0:40:00] <keepo__man> jesse should play the bible
[0:40:02] <dadm1lk> uwaaa!!!

[2:14:58] <AbstinenceRules> Jesse “reprimands” his wife
[2:15:00] <jakefogelnest> I thought he was going to win.
[2:15:04] <doubledarkhorse> you could hang a coat on the way that lady said JEW
[2:15:07] <AxisOfEntropy> he can't even be a judge anymore

[2:15:27] <milktoasting> jesse is correct
[2:15:28] <fathertiresias> i like how jesse says lawyer
[2:15:29] <jakefogelnest> It's insane
[2:15:35] <springconvert> Jesse is correct
[2:15:39] <UnPocoLoco23> White Ladies Love Roy Moore
[2:15:41] <jakefogelnest> Here's my thing: pedophiles? Get 'em out of here.

[2:15:47] <jakefogelnest> Knock it off with that stuff.
[2:15:54] <memeking2> men with kids supported him
[2:15:54] <Rory_OBrien> He won on the girls who he swayed with his manly charm
[2:15:55] <yarightdude> Early Graph>Early Grave
[2:15:55] <considerthetetrapod> jesse is bad
[2:15:56] <sausagehobbit> Jesse......
[2:15:57] <thredds> "you people"
[2:15:58] <jakefogelnest> Like these pedophiles - they need to cool it.
[2:16:01] <cuttle_5> what do you mean "you people"?

[2:16:24] <jt60564> the early yks eps are great
[2:16:24] <shoe3482> Just listen to Fishy Flip 8 times to start the podcast off
[2:16:24] <FredDurst2000> just keep identifying the fishes gamer
[2:16:25] <LRonFrancis> The Stewart Rodcast was amazing
[2:16:26] <yarightdude> RIP Stefan
[2:16:28] <jakefogelnest> I just think the whole thing with pedophiles is that they should think about knocking it off with that nonsense.
[2:16:29] <considerthetetrapod> go back and listen to them all after mike died
[2:16:30] <memeking2> kramer culpa is a fucking great episode
[2:16:35] <skelley9> men with kids went +14 for Moore, women with kids went +34 for Jones
[2:16:36] <milktoasting> unwoke to assume jesses wife doesnt want to be reprimanded imo
[2:16:40] <memeking2> in fact, you peaked with episode 2
[2:16:41] <AbstinenceRules> Jesse I jerk off to YKS
[2:16:46] <springconvert> Lol
[2:16:46] <biggest_fans> Kramer culpa is so good.

[2:17:09] <springconvert> Very good
[2:17:18] <AbstinenceRules> That’s such a good bit though
[2:17:18] <UnPocoLoco23> Thats like Jay Z's song Moonlight where he only references La La Land
[2:17:18] <FredDurst2000> what is up with that one static barracuda
[2:17:20] <biggest_fans> I actually jsut listened to a bunch of the old ones, how good it is is only matched by how bad it sounds.
[2:17:21] <jakefogelnest> But man, these pedophiles? They should get out of town. And you can take that to the bank.
[2:17:24] <considerthetetrapod> like the hat jesse
[2:17:25] <shoe3482> it could get worse than 1 goal
[2:17:27] <ghostlikemike> jesse where should i start listening to YKS
[2:17:27] <memeking2> have you heard that guy had to go to the hospital to get all the cum out of his stromach
[2:17:30] <shoe3482> you could score 0 goals
[2:17:32] <ghostlikemike> like what episode
[2:17:37] <springconvert> Jake, or to the jail
[2:17:37] <bizzyunderscore> Thats a brave stand jake

[2:17:57] <springconvert> The bank is like a jail for money
[2:17:57] <skelley9> 7 goals!? they're scoring more than Roy Moore at a Justin Bieber concert
[2:17:59] <claytondeth> Asuka

[2:22:21] <UnPocoLoco23> Get Someone To Rotoscope You and lady to a different location
[2:22:28] <springconvert> Lol
[2:22:33] <springconvert> What is this story?
[2:22:35] <dipshed> Jesse is the world's most misunderstood man, second to only Roy Moore
[2:22:36] <skelley9> the only 30 year old men who should be getting internships should be Roy Moore at a Hot Topic in 1981
[2:22:39] <ShooterMart> In his bed
[2:22:43] <Sinesthetic> who demands your freaking id in your own home
[2:22:48] <jakefogelnest> Rob's a Raya guy.
[2:22:56] <jakefogelnest> Rob's strictly Raya.
[2:22:59] <ShooterMart> Condoms
[2:23:05] <claytondeth> Rob was in the jungle
[2:23:11] <doubledarkhorse> they're called wine coolers in the states
[2:23:11] <springconvert> Why was jesse ID’d at home?
[2:23:11] <umjammer_danny> "in the wild" because women are animals
[2:23:14] <UnPocoLoco23> She was buying Percocet
[2:23:22] <springconvert> Ohhh
[2:23:24] <ghostlikemike> a big fat boy meal
[2:23:29] <mcdonnellpf> women over 40 are useless eh JEsse?
[2:23:30] <jakefogelnest> This Roy Moore guy? I don't like. But you know who I do like? Rudy Ray Moore.
[2:23:32] <Axault> atpRtsd4
[2:23:38] <springconvert> Hell yeah
[2:23:38] <MacPuzy> Grown up food
[2:23:42] <dipshed> the footage features Jesse shouting "I'm the freakin' beer idiot!" at this poor woman.
[2:23:47] <John_Olerud_> #DecentFloorPlan
[2:23:51] <thredds> \ BibleThump /
[2:23:54] <bizzyunderscore> That sounds like a solid plan
[2:23:57] <AbstinenceRules> My wife told me it’s cool to be cucked
[2:23:59] <claytondeth> Jesse stream yourself eating the pizza
[2:24:00] <Sinesthetic> BloodTrail cool story bro
[2:24:05] <datamarri> #DecentFloorPlan
[2:24:11] <sausagehobbit> lmao
[2:24:13] <springconvert> Just probably a coincidence
[2:24:15] <Rory_OBrien> But tell the carding story Jesse
[2:24:32] <jakefogelnest> Don't Floor Plan shame Jesse
[2:24:34] <nickconga> i like getting drunk and sad for my birthday and call it "getting sick" too
[2:24:34] <Axault> CoolCat
[2:24:55] <jakefogelnest> "rollaway bed action" is what I'm all about.
[2:24:57] <ghostlikemike> well you told us about that
[2:25:02] <claytondeth> My floor plan is drinking enough beers that I pass out on my bathroom floor
[2:25:03] <John_Olerud_> sounds practical to me
[2:25:04] <MacPuzy> Asuka fuck em up
[2:25:05] <krebex> get some rims for those wheels on your bed

[2:26:24] <UnPocoLoco23> Elfs need to unionize
[2:26:26] <springconvert> Makes sense
[2:26:26] <bierhorse> I've heard of being asleep at the wheel, but this is ridiculous!
