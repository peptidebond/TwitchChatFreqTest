[1:34:56] <buttdog69> "Love In An Elevator" was from Aerosmith's 1989 CD, "Pump". This was their lead-off single. The inspiration of the song came to Tyler when he was researching battleships. He also claimed the song was about an affair he had with a woman in a hotel elevator.

[1:35:51] <lord_googoo> Aerosmith's long-promised[135] blues album Honkin' on Bobo was released in 2004. This was a return to the band's roots, including recording the album in live sessions, working with former producer Jack Douglas, and laying down their blues rock grit.[135] It was followed by a live DVD, You Gotta Move, in December 2004,[6] culled from performances on the Honkin' on Bobo Tour.

[1:37:52] <lord_googoo> They were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame soon after their album was released, in late March 2001.[59] Aerosmith is the only band to be inducted to the Hall of Fame with a song active in the charts ("Jaded").[74] Later that year, the band performed as part of the United We Stand: What More Can I Give benefit concert in Washington D.C. for 9/11 victims and their families.[127] The band flew back to Indianapolis for a show the same night, as part of their Just Push Play Tour.

[1:43:50] <buttdog69> "The Other Side" was released on Aerosmith's "Pump" CD. There was controversy over plagiarism of the song "Standing In The Shadows Of Love", written by Lamont Dozier and brothers Brian and Eddie Holland. The case was settled when Tyler and co-writer Jim Vallance gave them songwriting credit.

[1:44:43] <buttdog69> "Train Kept A Rollin'" was from the "Get Your Wings" album. It originally was a blues song written by Tiny Bradshaw, Howard Kay and Lois Mann. The song was covered by several rock bands, such as The Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin and Metallica. Aerosmith recorded two versions of the song, as the single version omitted the echo and noise of the crowds, as added in the album version.

[2:36:02] <Land_Phil> i loved it when dr. oz was paid by the NFL to promote how safe football was
[2:36:04] <therudebeast> i have hundreds of old loveline episodes on my computer, the dr drew/adam carolla era, and it's my most shameful secret
[2:36:07] <TaintEnthusiast> I bet he has that weird doctor smell
[2:36:10] <M_Go_Dead> dr. uncle drew
[2:36:16] <TheFoxBride> Is this Jesse bronzehammer?
[2:36:20] <its_doggety> Carolla's just a straight shooter!
[2:36:23] <bloviated> If I was Dr. Drew I would just tell people to take some aspirin and rest and hope that doesn't fuck anyone up to obad
[2:36:35] <springbreakmyheart> you would not have thought he was worse than kimmel
[2:36:49] <TheFoxBride> This jackbox party pack looks sick
[2:37:09] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> i've heard of the corona virus, but sounds like adam's got the carollavirus!!!
[2:37:16] <Land_Phil> remember when stanhope and rogan hosted the man show?
[2:37:29] <serpentine666> celebrity doctor
[2:37:29] <pbostrom> hey what about Dr Feelgood though?
[2:37:31] <Land_Phil> for a year
[2:37:33] <farthammer1> I have DRASTICALLY reduced the amount of Segura I consume
[2:37:38] <chrome_chomsky> yeah thats fucked
[2:37:38] <AfroGunsou> sawbones is entertaining AND informative!
[2:37:39] <spennyspennyspenny> that's a permanent upgrade to your health, armor, or ammo
[2:37:42] <TheFoxBride> What about dr feelgood

[2:37:55] <farthammer1> SAME
[2:38:03] <therudebeast> @Land_Phil i feel a little odd about liking doug stanhope these days too
[2:38:09] <blackoutblar> interviewing tommy lee was pretty funny
[2:38:09] <Ohboymb> i remember dr drew asking every girl with a high voice if they'd been molested as a child because had a theory that it locked their voice in, and them being like "uh, no"
[2:38:12] <TheFoxBride> Has anyone heard of cumtown
[2:38:17] <FogRawGaming> the videos are amazing
[2:38:25] <Land_Phil> @therudebeast i never liked his stand up
[2:38:30] <farthammer1> And I am not too fond of his wife with the whole "Can't we take a joke I hate SJWs"
[2:38:41] <farthammer1> But I have seen Segura live 3 times
[2:38:42] <Land_Phil> @Ohboymb oh god i remember that
[2:38:43] <farthammer1> he rules
[2:38:45] <Sogetastic> @therudebeast what is stanhope's deal? I only saw him on screenwipe
[2:38:48] <its_doggety> @Ohboymb oh yeah, him and carolla still did that as of a few years ago when I used to listen to the podcast they did together
[2:39:02] <ruffdrafter> Hannibal Buress bums me out
[2:39:11] <therudebeast> @Sogetastic @Land_Phil he's like a defeatist bill hicks, if that makes sense
[2:39:23] <rodzirvin> Netflix put out so many standup specials that nobody gives a shit anymore
[2:39:25] <Sogetastic> yeah i think i get it
[2:39:33] <Land_Phil> not really lol
[2:39:37] <FogRawGaming> the guy that puts out a video asking some homeless guys to come fuck him and beat him and he'll pay their rent is hilarious
[2:39:38] <heycorvidae> thats the last time you had a bath?
[2:39:44] <Ohboymb> i liked chelsea peretti's special where she has cutaways to dogs instead of people laughing
[2:39:47] <GoOffKings> @heycorvidae noooo!
[2:39:48] <EpochError> lot of people did that jf
[2:39:52] <TheGreatCactusJac> plugging in the toaster, getting in the bath tub, watching a netflix special
[2:39:53] <therudebeast> well he's a more down-to-earth leary too, dennis, definitely not tim
[2:39:54] <meat_raffle> i always thought stanhope sucked, i've only seen him on screenwipe
[2:39:57] <carpenter_groot> the last one i watched was the Todd Barry crowdwork tour and it was good
[2:39:58] <DrOrpheusMD> mine was either dave chappelle on netflix or nanette
[2:40:00] <Land_Phil> i think the only stand up that i've seen that i liked was john mulaneys
[2:40:13] <Sogetastic> Chris played the dog
[2:40:14] <friggindummy> i like his new ones. not his best obviously buy not bad by any means
[2:40:35] <wwardlaw> I think the Chelsea Peretti special on netflix was great
[2:40:40] <Ohboymb> moshe and natasha leggero's podcast is really good
[2:40:42] <rodzirvin> I think it was Attell and Jeff Ross
[2:40:45] <Land_Phil> i saw stavros and adam frieland in person. stav was great, adam was okay
[2:40:45] <therudebeast> i got to show my coworker the carlin baseball vs football bit earlier today, it was the first time he saw it, he loved it
[2:40:51] <t0iletface> rory scovel and joe mande are the only recent standups i've liked
[2:40:52] <depitts> I got grilled bad at todd Barry's crowd work tour
[2:41:02] <pbostrom> Chappelle was probably the best and worst live standup shows I've seen; 2 different shows 2005/2012
[2:41:07] <farthammer1> You know who had a lowkey great special that nobody talked about? Nick DiPaolo.
[2:41:13] <rodzirvin> lmao
[2:41:13] <Nightbot> lol
[2:41:27] <carpenter_groot> @depitts did you make it into the special
[2:41:30] <farthammer1> lol
[2:41:31] <Nightbot> that's funny
[2:41:34] <farthammer1> no shit
[2:41:36] <farthammer1> I hate him
[2:41:40] <Ohboymb> scovel rules
[2:41:42] <FogRawGaming> moshe's hound tall podcast is pretty good
[2:41:49] <munt69> scovel is my favorite standup
[2:41:52] <friggindummy> what is mande doing? miss that guy
[2:41:52] <r_6509> Hey Chris I started a standup comedy course with Paul Sveen and quit halfway through cuz it sucked so hard
[2:41:54] <depitts> no it was the 2nd tour he did
[2:42:01] <therudebeast> rory on eric andre was so funny
[2:42:08] <TaintEnthusiast> I liked how Nick DiPaolo completely misspoke during his setups and left it in the special
[2:42:39] <rodzirvin> I did it for 3 years and then I got offered a job to move to Boston and never have done it again
[2:42:49] <owlyoop> how do you teach someone to be funny
[2:43:03] <Chexoid> yeah I don't think you can learn to be funny more than you can learn to be like, kind. it's something you gain from life experiences
[2:43:07] <r_6509> He thinks he’s a big hotshot canadian comic from Edmonton. He talked about his one special all the time.
[2:43:12] <DrOrpheusMD> i think a good class would just be a no pressure open mic
[2:43:13] <Ohboymb> it's important to learn how to fuck the stool
[2:43:17] <FrogStack> play like the mic is ur peen
[2:43:23] <winzigwinsbig> I did standup for a few years in college but haven’t been able to think of any new material after 2016 broke my brain
[2:43:28] <DrOrpheusMD> get some friendly practice in
[2:43:31] <Ohboymb> here's how you ask who drove the farthest to get there
[2:43:31] <r_6509> I thought it would be fun. I want to be funnier like you dudes.
[2:43:42] <Ohboymb> any birthdays out there tonight
[2:43:45] <r_6509> Everyone else in the course was over 35
[2:43:49] <rodzirvin> Sebastian Maniscalco stinks ass
[2:44:07] <r_6509> And they all told the worst jokes imaginable
[2:44:19] <Sogetastic> that rocks
[2:44:22] <owlyoop> oh cool
[2:44:29] <EpochError> stand up rob
[2:44:31] <uoenodoe> wooo
[2:44:46] <Down10_> Don't use Zoom, use Google Meet
[2:44:57] <Cornetto_32> i remember watching a maniscalco special just to see whats up and he had a bit about watching a woman eat a muffin out of a bag at starbucks. very funny. tight pants.
[2:45:01] <friggindummy> like nick cannon in wild n out if you will?
[2:45:02] <rodzirvin> I'm gonna look very stupid on camera so you guys can do crowdwork
[2:45:02] <Ohboymb> i'll do a guest spot if you can guarantee no check drop during my set
[2:45:03] <official_genius> i hope Rob keeps making vids
[2:45:13] <munt69> I don't wanna download zoom
[2:45:16] <pbostrom> Google Meet is a troll
[2:45:21] <Down10_> It's a security issue!
[2:45:44] <rodzirvin> CHECK PLEASE
[2:45:57] <EpochError> ohboymb is an insider
[2:45:58] <owlyoop> i forgot what zoom does but yea there are security issues
[2:46:02] <r_6509> Zoom sucks for so many reasons but it’s also the easiest thing to use by so far
[2:46:05] <carpenter_groot> check drop, did someone get deverified on twitter

[2:47:52] <RevRagu> being a doctor
[2:47:57] <Ohboymb> the hardest part is taking the mic out of the stand
[2:48:00] <sawyerstinks> came back to get my second sub emote kingsUhh i don’t like this one as much.
[2:48:01] <Nightbot> Hey, if you've got Amazon Prime, you can link it up to your Twitch account and get a free stream subscription! Which you can then use on this stream! Pretty neat!
[2:48:04] <rodzirvin> It's easier when you sit down
[2:48:23] <Sogetastic> I can't be the only one who thinks that if you put together a stand-up show with just army vets it would be the best shit ever
[2:48:23] <Land_Phil> oh shit
[2:48:24] <EpochError> @sawyerstinks yeah stefan emotes have limited utility

[2:49:04] <EpochError> like the walking dead?
[2:49:04] <farthammer1> Bike lanes?
[2:49:05] <rodzirvin> The alleys are also for the muggers
[2:49:09] <munt69> let people milly rock
[2:49:11] <owlyoop> new standup idea: what if you talk about politics in it. talk about how much you love trump
[2:49:15] <wwardlaw> They're closing some streets to cars here so pedestrians have more space
[2:49:16] <serpentine666> YES
[2:49:21] <Chexoid> same thing for driveways stay out of them
[2:49:26] <farthammer1> Is alley walk Canadian for Bike Lane
[2:49:27] <official_genius> didn't have the kind of ice cream i like. FAIL!!
[2:49:30] <Down10_> She can eat all the ice cream she wants. idgaf
[2:49:30] <0mnivore> I was bummed we didn't get to see her second fridge
[2:49:33] <Max_Hanson> yas queen is my perspective on it
[2:49:36] <FrogStack> cram her in there
[2:49:36] <chrome_chomsky> 10,000 MFs (mitches fridges)
[2:49:42] <owlyoop> those freezers cost 11k and she has 2
[2:49:46] <sawyerstinks> feels like jf doesn’t want chris here.
[2:49:56] <drill_the_grass> alley walking, what is she on a new fitness routine?
[2:49:58] <Down10_> If people are mad about that, they need to get a fucking life!
[2:49:59] <TaintEnthusiast> they were roasting mitch pretty hard on meet the press

[2:50:22] <jamberg> i'm TIRED of going over this
[2:50:25] <Sogetastic> she rules land_phil
[2:50:30] <depitts> the Atlantic has to play the contrarian angle
[2:50:35] <completebreakfast> maybe it's a normal sized fridge and the food is really big??
[2:50:35] <EpochError> mini-fridges are less efficient than a regular fridge so mitch is hurting both his own storage space and the earth
[2:50:58] <wwardlaw> I heard he scraped the word mini off it with a butter knife and thought no one would notice
[2:50:59] <DaveGrier> all bosses are devils

[3:01:59] <M_Go_Dead> just reese's eggs with pieces inside of them
[3:02:04] <Down10_> Reese's is weird once you realize the peanut butter in them is not the same as the peanut butter we buy in jars
[3:02:05] <owlyoop> this is the dick smashing room
[3:02:05] <0mnivore> Reese's pumpkins are similar to the egg

[3:20:32] <DrOrpheusMD> is drew tarver the southern boy who does the stuff with carl tart?
[3:20:37] <europeansheep> yes

[3:24:09] <BobbyLightweight> this series of battles is effing nuts
[3:24:15] <M_Go_Dead> there is an episode in season 2 that is one of the best episodes of tv I'v ever seen
[3:24:15] <Megaspel> Barry is a "comedy" show. In a modern sense, comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōidía) is a genre of fiction that refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, stand-up comedy, books and novels or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece
[3:24:16] <sawyerstinks> @evilhalfnoodles, with a quail egg yeah, but those are small.

[3:25:13] <Nightbot> WEDNESDAY. The day you flumpty-foo! And you think boopty-bop and zippity-zoom but the truth is, razza frazza wuzza wooza.
