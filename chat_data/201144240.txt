[0:34:43] <BroPair> Jesse Farrar It‚Äôs Pat Sega Genesis speedrun
[0:34:46] <howintensive> i saw jackass 3d in theaters at midnight when it came out and it was amazing
[0:34:47] <doosteroo> wasn't there actually a jackass game though
[0:34:47] <bakkooonn> was jackass 2 the one where he drank the horse cum
[0:34:50] <ihav4gotn> rob looks handsome KappaPride
[0:34:52] <sharkbutt> lol
[0:34:58] <umjammer_danny> I think so
[0:35:00] <Boomhauer1988> Hate to be the one to say this, but you kind of suck at Wayne‚Äôs world the video game, jf. Do you even shred ‚Äòtar?
[0:35:04] <bakkooonn> somebody in the theater puked when he drank the horse cum and everybody clapped :)
[0:35:08] <Hank____Scorpio> Which sect of Islam does Jesse follow/
[0:35:10] <doosteroo> jackass game was on the ps2 and psp, confirmed
[0:35:13] <doubledarkhorse> team america holds up
[0:35:17] <d_o_n_n_y_> team america isn't that bad actually
[0:35:18] <turnpike74> it actually does mostly hold up
[0:35:21] <goatshead> how has rob's tinder adventures gone lately?
[0:35:22] <gabagooligan> Team America is good
[0:35:23] <ghostlikemike> wow jesse farrar is a centrist
[0:35:28] <BaguetteMonk> i believe jesse is wahabbist
[0:35:46] <durkuniverse> Jackass 3D was art
[0:35:47] <sharkbutt> was the horse a gamer
[0:36:02] <keepo__man> the best jackass stunt was ryan dunn in porsche driving
[0:36:03] <dh2121> i got drunk at the movie theater and left to throw up during murder on the orient express
[0:36:05] <pissmister> that was chris pontius pilate
[0:36:08] <biggest_fans> Yup, plastic sweat suit.
[0:36:08] <manwithnodick> When will Jesse drink horse cum
[0:36:11] <ghostlikemike> the grossest bit is the toenail penis bit
[0:36:22] <doosteroo> lance bangs threw up during the paper cut thing
[0:36:24] <doosteroo> it was sick
[0:36:24] <ihav4gotn> RIP Ryan Dunn BlessRNG
[0:36:31] <GlassRadish> oh those jackass boys
[0:36:36] <bakkooonn> OH, the one where steve-o wore a space helmet connected to the fat mans butt and he shits and farts into the helmet and steve-o puked
[0:36:39] <durkuniverse> Steve O ate shit was the grossest one
[0:36:53] <bakkooonn> THE DEAD ONE
[0:36:54] <d_o_n_n_y_> mike hale
[0:36:54] <umjammer_danny> that was the worst one for me bakoon
[0:36:56] <howintensive> bam
[0:36:56] <durkuniverse> Fuck
[0:36:58] <johnwaynegassy> Dave England was my favorite to see get hurt
[0:37:00] <HandsomeNormalMan> mel gibson
[0:37:02] <fjordstheatre> Pontius
[0:37:06] <doctorbug> paper cuts in the first one is actually the most painful thing i've watched
[0:37:07] <dh2121> pontius
[0:37:07] <fjordstheatre> Party Boy baby
[0:37:09] <ghostlikemike> ryan dunn rip
[0:37:13] <bakkooonn> party boy
[0:37:17] <doctorbug> dave
[0:37:19] <GlassRadish> party boy was best
[0:37:20] <keepo__man> ryan dunn driving his car
[0:37:21] <Claytonlessland> Donald drumphf
[0:37:22] <durkuniverse> Probably Johnny because of his reaction to everything was fantastic
[0:37:22] <howintensive> change mine to pontius
[0:37:23] <gabagooligan> My favorites jackass bit is getting drunk and crashing my car
[0:37:23] <bakkooonn> dave englund shitting in the little tiny bathroom was amazing
[0:37:27] <goatshead> RIP dead Jackass guy, heaven's putting together one hell of a band
[0:37:27] <doctorbug> dave for his shitting
[0:37:32] <kremdog28> When the jackass guy died
[0:37:35] <Hank____Scorpio> The LA boys look like a boy band and Jesse looks like their manager
[0:37:40] <big_casual> BEETHOVEN 2
[0:37:40] <bakkooonn> lol yeah
[0:37:47] <keepo__man> don vito rip
[0:37:49] <GlassRadish> holy lol
[0:37:50] <BrettW7> hi
[0:37:53] <love_too_watch_games> I liked when the penis was in the mouse puppet
[0:37:54] <johnwaynegassy> Him screaming AHHH MY ASS. MY FUCKIN ASS after the firehose is the best
[0:37:57] <durkuniverse> Though Dave England saying "OW MY ASSHOLE" I quote a lot
[0:38:14] <howintensive> jesse is a dog haha
[0:38:15] <brian_hanson> "rescue chubby"
[0:38:17] <bakkooonn> jesse is doing a speedrun of bethoven 2
[0:38:21] <turnpike74> good dog
[0:38:21] <big_casual> Jesse cmon
[0:38:22] <dropkickchannel> beethoven has the same attack as wayne
[0:38:25] <d_o_n_n_y_> are those the twin towers
[0:38:35] <doctorbug> i'm imagining an animorph cover of jesse becoming a dog
[0:38:36] <bbuckethead> wee man asking where the card throwing machine is after they kept shocking his ass is probably the hardest I've ever laughed
[0:38:36] <durkuniverse> Jackass was the highest of art comedy
[0:38:37] <GlassRadish> you have to kill that 90s kid
[0:38:45] <big_casual> in Beethoven 2 Beethoven the dog is racist
[0:38:47] <howintensive> i liked the jackass episode when they did the gumball rally
[0:39:03] <doosteroo> I looked away bc I'm playing Kingdom Hearts, is this Tim Allen's The Shaggy Dog
[0:39:04] <sharkbutt> what was the point of beethoven other than it was a big dog?
[0:39:10] <BrolandoArrojo> is this the greatest of all charles grodin video games?
[0:39:10] <goatshead> Jackass is the height of white culture tbh
[0:39:20] <doctorbug> are there any shops of jesse doing an animorph into a dog?
[0:39:25] <turnpike74> achieving dog's ultimate goal: killing man
[0:39:35] <doubledarkhorse> holy shit this game sucks
[0:39:53] <durkuniverse> That was awesome
[0:39:53] <keepo__man> dick fireworks
[0:39:55] <bakkooonn> the vomit omelette bit from the show is maybe the grossest single jackass bit to me
[0:39:57] <big_casual> actually this game is good.
[0:40:10] <dh2121> the terrorist pube beard
[0:40:15] <GlassRadish> Beehtoven can't kill and eat smaller animals to regain health
[0:40:30] <BaguetteMonk> the dark souls of dog platformers
[0:40:33] <NotJasonMaybe> "Is Butterbean ok?"
[0:40:34] <doosteroo> oh man, butterbean is from my hometown
[0:40:43] <fjordstheatre> Bark at it
[0:40:45] <doubledarkhorse> escort missions are the worst
[0:40:48] <bakkooonn> dogs are a HUGE liability
[0:40:49] <ghostlikemike> the one where wee man fights the other little person
[0:40:59] <big_casual> RIP beethoven
[0:41:05] <Hotfoot28> this game is so old, surely all of these dogs are dead by now
[0:41:06] <d_o_n_n_y_> beethoven's escort mission
[0:41:08] <Ratbrother> bitch dog just got killed by gravity
[0:41:16] <nonamehover> fucking slam
[0:41:23] <GlassRadish> classic Canadian breakfast
[0:41:30] <ghostlikemike> how has nobody made a full jackass collection on TPB
[0:41:31] <big_casual> you need to make Beethoven jump better
[0:41:33] <bakkooonn> use the screw attack
[0:41:40] <fjordstheatre> Hit R
[0:41:41] <doosteroo> why do beethoven and wayne shoot the same projectiles
[0:41:41] <manwithnodick> Attack a neighbourhood kid
[0:41:44] <EichenwaldsHentai> Jesse's biggest enemy in this game is fences
[0:41:51] <Hank____Scorpio> Beethoven's only natural predator- fences
[0:41:54] <peepeeman2000> try a running jump
[0:41:54] <manwithnodick> That's how you win the game
[0:41:58] <djfoss> this game promotes dogfighting
[0:42:01] <sharkbutt> why is there a sfence blocking the sidewalk anyway
[0:42:02] <bakkooonn> lol
[0:42:09] <dh2121> just take a running start bitch
[0:42:16] <BroPair> The famous cat killing scene from Beethoven
[0:42:17] <pissmister> eat the apple
[0:42:19] <nonamehover> wonder if Michael vick is the final boss
[0:42:23] <love_too_watch_games> I‚Äôd argue that if it blocks you it‚Äôs the best fence
[0:42:28] <Hank____Scorpio> Get the upgrade that gives Beethoven thumbs to open the gate
[0:42:31] <Claytonlessland> Try opening the gate
[0:42:34] <considerthetetrapod> boycott gamer cum
[0:42:41] <howintensive> i love the beethoven's bad father simulator
[0:42:46] <GlassRadish> holy hell there are 8 beethoven movies
[0:42:51] <fjordstheatre> Play as Charles Grodin
[0:42:59] <Ratbrother> any chance you could find some thumbs to open it
[0:43:12] <big_casual> respect Beethoven
[0:43:15] <d_o_n_n_y_> stefan tell jesse that you are supposed to pick up the baby dog
[0:43:30] <keepo__man> can you be air bud
[0:43:32] <Boomhauer1988> Someone calm the cops on this asshole skateboarder trying to murder a dog
[0:43:38] <Hank____Scorpio> Charles Grodin died from rabies he got from Beethoven
[0:43:42] <nonamehover> obviously
[0:43:55] <turnpike74> nice jump!!
[0:44:00] <djfoss> oh no you died in front of your son
[0:44:12] <BroPair> Beethoven 2 is for Jesse the level of difficulty most people had with Myst
[0:44:13] <considerthetetrapod> the frequency of the sybian is gonna blow my laptop speakers
[0:44:16] <keepo__man> throw the dog in the trash can to win
[0:44:29] <nonamehover> I love that every single object in this game is a different texture
[0:44:31] <gabagooligan> He‚Äôll yeah
[0:44:32] <munt69> hey mike
[0:44:33] <bakkooonn> get kevin spacey on the stream please

[0:49:38] <BroPair> Isaac Newton discovered gravity from a falling apple while Jesse was kept from completing a childrens game from 1994
[0:49:40] <Ratbrother> that dog just murdered a child
