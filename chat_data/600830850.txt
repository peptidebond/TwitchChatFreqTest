[0:55:39] <markovblanket> jesus was the first person to eat ass
[0:55:40] <drippedout> A long time ago, people had shit all over their asshole. Maybe someone ate someone else's asshole while it had doo doo on it a long time ago. Makes you think
[0:55:41] <Chexoid> nice little fable
[0:55:43] <cecilgol> surprise! it was St. Augustine
[0:55:44] <BloodWorms> and who was the first person to suck a freaking cows titties???

[0:56:04] <SocialistWaluigi> the huntsman, what is this freakin snow white?
[0:56:11] <Chexoid> reading r/standupshots causes severe psychic damage

[0:57:12] <Cornetto_32> this is next level stuff
[0:57:21] <zach_fla_> chatLetsgo
[0:57:21] <snes_classic_chalmers> looks even narrower
[0:57:22] <drippedout> i think jesse has lost too much weight
[0:57:24] <andyateacrayon> I know exactly what to look at now
[0:57:26] <Down10_> Q
[0:57:27] <migrainethresher> JF's skill level has already increased so much
[0:57:28] <considerthetetrapod> “It’s really just an aspect ratio change.”
[0:57:29] <ChuddTruckley> gaming with quibiblio
[0:57:30] <SocialistWaluigi> Jesse is always gaming with gas
[0:57:31] <comradequest> is it possible to make it narrower
[0:57:34] <Cornetto_32> has quibiblio mode been updated and improved?
[0:57:37] <bloviated> I tried to make a stand up shots joke but couldn't figure out from google if any stand up comedians have been murdered on stage
[0:57:44] <therudebeast> i'm going to fuck up this "liar sleeps tonight" alert so fucking hard
[0:57:50] <kmm48> whats that? I cant see
[0:57:54] <migrainethresher> fire is good against all troops
[0:57:56] <wwardlaw> Optimized for your ocular consumption @Cornetto320
[0:57:59] <markovblanket> send yoda after him
[0:58:03] <eboe> chat trying to help jesse out arent realizing quibiblio mode is all the help you need
[0:58:06] <Down10_> we should also have a square Instagram mode
[0:58:08] <Chexoid> give up jesse
[0:58:08] <listenerdave> quibiblio is testing my TV's capabilities like a steely dan record tests stereos
[0:58:09] <pbostrom> damn this looks good
[0:58:16] <considerthetetrapod> !quibiblio
[0:58:21] <splinkerbell> i have never thought this game could look this good
[0:58:30] <Faralay> Ugh
[0:58:33] <andyateacrayon> ah
[0:58:36] <Cornetto_32> This is so immersive.
[0:58:37] <AfroGunsou> after quibiblio mode started my TV began smoking???
[0:58:45] <BloodWorms> most thermometers are alcohol these days actually
[0:58:47] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> 1930s ass joke
[0:58:50] <eboe> we are too focused in
[0:58:58] <spicesquad> This joke brought to you from https://www.quibiblio.com/
[0:58:58] <drill_the_grass> video is a bit too wide on my screen
[0:58:59] <andyateacrayon> JF beats the miniboss in quibiblio mode? coincidence? I don't think so
[0:59:04] <bloviated> this is how I used to game when i was cross eyed
[0:59:08] <spookytapes> wow this looks great on my HDTV
[0:59:08] <scrunkbucket> call the quibiblio phone number

[1:01:33] <AfroGunsou> i didnt hear that one stefan
[1:01:36] <apfrederick> Screen kind of looks squished
[1:01:36] <porchcrop> how old are those ads anyway?
[1:01:37] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> @goodfriendjake try refreshing the stream so it's in quibiblio mode. sounds like it froze for you

[1:02:10] <CDBreakfast> Jake Flores' tweet about a game starring shinra middle manager
[1:02:13] <tubapuddingjr> cut scenes work so good in quibiblio mode
[1:02:14] <considerthetetrapod> if the screen looks squished check your monitor settings please
[1:02:20] <chormbly> ugh at that
[1:02:20] <ChuddTruckley> my computer can't handle quibiblio mode, need to upgrade
[1:02:22] <mccullers> is the screen weirdly stretched out too wide for anyone? do i need to change my aspect ratio?
[1:02:23] <MikeASchneider> it's chris's fault
[1:02:23] <wickerfurnature> 5g
[1:02:24] <Chexoid> i love being a guy in a suit and talking back to a 9 foot tall 360 pound guy with a minigun hand

[1:02:35] <naffologist> quobama
[1:02:38] <buttbuttpeeman> Quibiblio is HIGHLY optimized, but it is very intensive on the CPU.

[1:03:19] <BloodWorms> no the cum boils
[1:03:20] <eboe> i want to blow Shinra Middle Managers brains out
[1:03:24] <andyateacrayon> it optimizes the cum laterally just like quibiblio
[1:03:29] <migrainethresher> if someone eats your cum on 5g they hear the dialup noise
[1:03:29] <tito_dunkberg> it grows the cum
[1:03:33] <LaOwlLOL> has quibiblio mode gotten even more condense since last night?
[1:03:34] <HeftyCurvesAndy> great thing about quibi, it's ceo ran ebay into the ground trying to buy skype
[1:03:36] <wwardlaw> Makes it fine souffle
[1:03:48] <listenerdave> heart healthy pizza
[1:03:49] <TaintEnthusiast> theory: 5G conspiracy theories are being spread on purpose to distract from the real problem of 5G hurting the effectiveness of weather forcasts
[1:03:51] <bloviated> what's machine gun arm guy's name again?
[1:03:54] <Chexoid> everyone wants to be able to eat cum without turning into a baby but it's a fantasy.
[1:03:55] <bloviated> Garret?
[1:04:00] <buttbuttpeeman> @andyateacrayon Andy's right. It lines up the cum molecules to make them extra potent.
[1:04:00] <shampoodler> salmon bag
[1:04:03] <apfrederick> I turned my tv on its side but its not reorienting please help its a sansung

[1:04:26] <khajimak> choo choo
[1:04:29] <migrainethresher> @TaintEnthusiast the weather satellite disruption is itself a smokescreen for the activation of Obama's weather machine
[1:04:30] <Down10_> Jessie is thirsty for Cloud
[1:04:31] <Chexoid> bernie says you can eat cum without turning into a baby but it just doesnt work like that in real life
[1:04:33] <nasty_nasty_nasty> remember train? that shit used to hi
[1:04:37] <farthammer1> Jesse do you want more cakies or are you good? I am making more tomorrow.
[1:04:38] <bloviated> machine gun arm guy would have argued with everyone in his mentions if he was on twitter today it'd ruin him
[1:04:39] <big__soda> I'll be honest, I'm kind of liking Quibiblio mode
[1:04:40] <tito_dunkberg> if i had one wish it would be to sustain myself on my cum alone
[1:04:43] <ChrisKyleMacLachlan> I mean who isnt @Down10_
[1:04:51] <AfroGunsou> jessie is even hotter in quibiblio mode!

[2:24:50] <bobricebobrice> quibiblio
[2:24:50] <wwardlaw> The announcer says we're all square, but there's no squares allowed in quibiblio mode
[2:24:54] <SoundAlerts> marxfarts played Jesse Fart (Loud) for 10 Bits
[2:24:59] <Down10_> this is an aggressive mode of viewing
[2:25:00] <supertevs> Sound needs to be compressed to match imo
[2:25:00] <therudebeast> so far i have tried to sync up "liar sleeps tonight" with: in the club, straight out of compton, vengaboys, and tom waits
[2:25:02] <lucid_glitch> On mobile this is fucking dememnted
[2:25:05] <shoe3482> the kings torture the fans and themselves
[2:25:09] <supertevs> or chopped and screwed in some way
[2:25:12] <foygus_> quibiblio turns a booty mode stream into a beauty mode stream
[2:25:19] <TheGreatCactusJac> kingsStefanWin
[2:25:22] <shoe3482> lol
[2:25:22] <Nightbot> that's funny
[2:25:28] <drippedout> Jesse Time
[2:25:32] <eboe> stefan winning would be so funny
[2:25:33] <owlyoop> kingsPINKJESSE
[2:25:37] <eboe> !jesse time
[2:25:37] <Nightbot> Jesse loves eating his own crap. He loves crapping into his mouth. He lays on his back and craps into the air and the crap falls into his mouth.
[2:25:37] <P0CKET_> wow, action mode clearer in quibiblio mode
[2:25:42] <migrainethresher> 11-12? what's next, 13?
[2:25:44] <TheGreatCactusJac> kingsCMON
[2:25:55] <therudebeast> HERE WE GO JF, HERE WE GO (clap clap)
[2:25:58] <owlyoop> yea 13 is next
[2:26:04] <GhoulSzn22> looks like a goddamn halfpipe
[2:26:10] <M_Go_Dead> did the announcer say get loud for your favorite 3 players?
[2:26:25] <forensic_beedrill> The stream is in the aspect ratio of the ice. It’s brilliant
[2:26:37] <M_Go_Dead> what a game
[2:26:37] <therudebeast> the big man comes through
[2:26:38] <GhoulSzn22> EPIC
[2:26:44] <eboe> threes player (like the gamemode) @M_Go_Dead
