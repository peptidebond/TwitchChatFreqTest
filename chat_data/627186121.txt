[0:53:35] <colonelfarva> really liking rob's shuffle here
[0:53:38] <dmchandler> @farthammer1 Yeah, I remember it being good, and when it came out there was a small "actually guys it's good, it's not dumb" movement, and people being yikes about that one scene
[0:53:44] <hurglehurgle> 53 card pick up
[0:53:53] <sawks> rob you can rent it from the library of congress

[0:55:24] <hurglehurgle> Kevin James drove a bus full of schoolchildren into a lake. look it up
[0:55:28] <dmchandler> but it looked like a goofy comedy so most people were annoyed at observe and report, it's fun to see the larger change in opinion
