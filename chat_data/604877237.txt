[1:24:34] <LilacWhimski> game bugged a bit because he fell
[1:24:48] <GhoulSzn22> woof

[1:25:10] <ghostlikemike> probably some random fodder up here
[1:25:10] <patbicks> A lot of people’s girlfriends are up there
[1:25:18] <The_Wizard_Adam> no one thought anyone could fall that badly, but jf managed
[1:25:29] <CDBreakfast> they never tested the "being a ding dong and falling off" case
[1:25:30] <bitesperry> that one freak
[1:25:40] <TaintEnthusiast> he was just a little guy
[1:25:46] <uoenodoe> how many hours are you at?

[1:26:24] <KaiSquared> yes, if only you could figure out how to get a job where you get paid to play video games
[1:26:27] <TaintEnthusiast> the band Rush used to test their albums' sound mixes using a shitty car stereo
[1:26:32] <McCainFlightSchool> getting a job is maybe the easiest thing you can do
[1:26:36] <trash_k1ng> that's a jf shelf
[1:26:57] <SoundAlerts> DougCrap played Rules Were Made For Breakin for 100 Bits
[1:26:58] <bighowellandpossum> JF is like. this game should be a straight walkway with no way to fall off

[1:33:22] <WretchedNerd> @LilStinker this is like fighting Charles Oakley
[1:33:23] <evilcheeba> I've never played the game before, but I think you need ammo to shoot the gun
[1:33:29] <ghostlikemike> the fists restore blood punch

[1:34:55] <noprankradio> lol
[1:34:55] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:34:59] <SoundAlerts> KaiSquared played Whiff (Louder) for 150 Bits
[1:34:59] <LilStinker> missing him is actually a bug
[1:35:00] <JasonUnknown> lol
[1:35:02] <chrome_chomsky> to us youre the biggest guy in gaming
[1:35:02] <oldnick42> Fast for a big man.
[1:35:02] <LilacWhimski> i was about to type at least you cant miss too
[1:35:04] <trash_k1ng> he's not big just real close
[1:35:17] <bitesperry> you can't get this sort of DOOM gameplay anywhere else folks
[1:35:18] <TaintEnthusiast> I missed a guy that size in borderlands 3 a few months ago, solidarity
[1:35:30] <GhoulSzn22> @KaiSquared nailed it
[1:35:46] <bighowellandpossum> try shooting him in the titty
[1:36:00] <oldnick42> Yeah just keep shooting his armor parts.
[1:36:19] <bitesperry> this guy is so much easier than the previous boss though
[1:36:26] <BBJoey> his head ain't armoured any more jf
[1:36:30] <turkatim> haven't played any of the dooms since doom ii, but just remembered the berserk pack, like the black medkit, that shit ruled
[1:36:33] <pecotaredux> you got his head
[1:36:40] <imthinkingdarbys> is that a quad damage up there? that floating ball up at the top
[1:36:47] <bitesperry> ugly son of a bitch
[1:36:49] <LilacWhimski> hit those arms king
[1:36:54] <ghostlikemike> sword is infinite

[1:37:49] <KaiSquared> seem like they'd just keep the health pickups and ammo boxes away from their huge boss who doesn't need or use them
[1:37:54] <goodfriendjake> shoot his arms jf!
[1:38:04] <oldnick42> Kill those arms.
[1:38:10] <LilacWhimski> shoot those arms
[1:38:19] <umjammer_danny> the arms are the hard part
[1:38:22] <oldnick42> Drill the grass and shoot the arms.
[1:38:22] <bighowellandpossum> shoot him!
[1:38:35] <BBJoey> jf his head doesn't have armour.............
[1:38:38] <Nightbot> Listen to T̶o̶i̶l̶e̶t̶ ̶P̶e̶n̶i̶s̶ Blocked Party and rate it 5 stars for Little Stefan! https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/blocked-party/id1442925390?mt=2
[1:38:47] <DougCrap> try using your gun to shoot them
[1:38:48] <GenePeanus> only shoot his arms jf the rest is immune
[1:38:54] <MyHeroZer0> stop shooting his face it doesn't have armor anymore
[1:38:59] <JeeceyFairer> its counterintuitive that you don't shoot the parts without any armor
[1:39:00] <lingerstink> if you think this is cool, try loading up doom2.wad and then typing in idclev30. its basically the same thing
[1:39:00] <KaiSquared> sword looks fun
[1:39:02] <carpenter_groot> damn
[1:39:03] <oldnick42> Damn it.
[1:39:11] <shoe3482> time heck
[1:39:14] <durkuniverse> well it didn't then
[1:39:15] <oldnick42> Shoot the armor parts off, then ignore those parts once the armor is gone.
[1:39:16] <pecotaredux> his face had armor, you shot it off
[1:39:16] <durkuniverse> it'll be back
[1:39:16] <Clopsy> it will have armor but you shot it off a while ago
[1:39:19] <jamberg> No!!!!!
[1:39:26] <BBJoey> it's real
[1:39:29] <lingerstink> sorry doom2 .wad is the actual data file for doom2
[1:39:38] <Nightbot> Hey, if you've got Amazon Prime, you can link it up to your Twitch account and get a free stream subscription! Which you can then use on this stream! Pretty neat!
[1:39:45] <Max_Hanson> Max_Hanson subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[1:39:50] <BBJoey> we love our wads don't we folks
[1:39:50] <yarightdude> theyve been following since day 1. damn
[1:39:52] <TaintEnthusiast> I seek protection from Allah against the Devil. In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful the Most Compassionate
[1:39:53] <carpenter_groot> JF did you ever play Chex Quest
[1:39:57] <lingerstink> it is not an actual link. or should not be
[1:40:03] <imthinkingdarbys> i wouldn't have thought .wad was a domain
[1:40:04] <chrome_chomsky> check out doom.cum for more fun times
[1:40:17] <BBJoey> there we go
[1:40:31] <KaiSquared> @chrome_chomsky is that in reference to the doom cum t-shirt?
[1:40:34] <Nightbot> If you're a sub, come be a little paypiggy on our Discord! crao https://discord.gg/VraKPdv
[1:40:46] <CDBreakfast> cum.doom
[1:40:52] <lingerstink> the doom dum shirt rocks
[1:40:52] <imthinkingdarbys> he looks like the rock's old bull tattoo now that his head armor is gone
[1:40:52] <ghostlikemike> his arm fell off
[1:40:56] <BBJoey> 4/8
[1:40:56] <GhoulSzn22> why doesn't this guy simply grab you and smush you?
[1:40:57] <lingerstink> ugh. cum
[1:41:04] <TaintEnthusiast> if you say the shahada you will win
[1:41:06] <1matthew_sp> this guy is crazy big
[1:41:07] <WretchedNerd> no dick
[1:41:09] <ghostlikemike> get the orb
[1:41:10] <chrome_chomsky> lol no but it should be
[1:41:10] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:41:17] <WretchedNerd> kind of a letdown
[1:41:25] <KaiSquared> oh is he mad because of he has no dick?
[1:41:27] <bighowellandpossum> shooting this big guy's clothes off. kinda hot
[1:41:27] <chrome_chomsky> doom cum wife guy is good
[1:41:27] <KaiSquared> (jesse)
[1:41:46] <imthinkingdarbys> i always found .bike confusing
[1:41:48] <LilacWhimski> political parties could use it
[1:41:48] <intjperspective> lemon dot party
[1:41:49] <LilStinker> it would be cool to have a sword in each hand
[1:41:50] <forsalebypwner> somebody registered it already :(
[1:41:54] <forsalebypwner> it would have only been $2
[1:41:57] <GhoulSzn22> sword play
[1:42:02] <lingerstink> so-called icon of sin, but no dinger
[1:42:21] <BBJoey> he'll punch you sometimes
[1:42:25] <scratchy_record> Remember to say “Welcome to Earth”
[1:42:30] <pecotaredux> he's the we-con of sin when JF's there
[1:42:37] <patbicks> Name a more iconic sin
[1:42:41] <Sogetastic> how can it be an icon if it isn't wearinf aiden pearce's hat?
[1:42:45] <umjammer_danny> seems like he could easily just tear the whole building down
[1:42:49] <forsalebypwner> i could register toiletpenis.party though, probably a better name
[1:43:01] <BBJoey> 6/8!!!
[1:43:26] <ghostlikemike> just need the right arm and his belly i think
[1:43:27] <BBJoey> JF use the chaingun
[1:43:32] <ghostlikemike> nope just the arm
[1:43:34] <BBJoey> oh jeese
[1:43:42] <durkuniverse> you got fucked up
[1:43:54] <TaintEnthusiast> you will not beat this demon without help from god, we all know this
[1:44:01] <ghostlikemike> do you want the baby armor?
[1:44:04] <bitesperry> fucking pinky man
[1:44:05] <KaiSquared> that's not too too good
[1:44:09] <forsalebypwner> .sucks top level domains are still like $200 frekaing dollars
[1:44:14] <JeeceyFairer> oof you got luigi armor
[1:44:18] <JasonUnknown> !jfdied
[1:44:18] <Nightbot> JF has died 161 times!
[1:44:21] <WretchedNerd> this looks so hard; we're still proud
[1:44:22] <forsalebypwner> so no yourkickstarter.sucks
[1:44:28] <durkuniverse> i'll forgive you
[1:44:31] <turkatim> !db
[1:44:31] <Nightbot> WE LOVE DB!!!!
[1:44:36] <ButtmasterX> Our lord and savor Jesus Christ amen
[1:44:59] <TaintEnthusiast> I urge everyone in this chat to convert to islam immediately so that JF can beat this demon
[1:45:09] <KaiSquared> i mean... [my first name].sucks is available and two grand, so i think 199 ain't too bad for yourkickstarter.sucks
[1:45:12] <imthinkingdarbys> i feel like the company Syrenity should have at least one more Y in its name
[1:45:16] <pecotaredux> maybe go for the arms first since they seem to be harder to hit?
[1:45:23] <umjammer_danny> you didn't take the baby armor
[1:45:52] <GenePeanus> big green gun is very good when threes a lot of very strong demons runnin around
[1:46:03] <KaiSquared> i love that little slimer guy
[1:46:20] <lingerstink> its cool, this part is tough
[1:46:39] <imthinkingdarbys> i want a chaingun that morphs into 4 chainguns
[1:47:36] <KaiSquared> now i've heard of one punch man. but one punch???
[1:47:40] <MyHeroZer0> ONE PUUUUUUUNCH
[1:48:18] <KaiSquared> this motherfucker moves around a lot
[1:49:03] <ghostlikemike> oh jesse
[1:49:03] <umjammer_danny> lol
[1:49:03] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:49:08] <durkuniverse> 7 does look like 3 sometimes
[1:49:26] <forsalebypwner> I don't have that kinda money but maybe one of their generous benefactors would consider dropping the two hundo @KaiSquared
[1:49:29] <ghostlikemike> a low three though, everything left took a lot of hits
[1:49:50] <TaintEnthusiast> our lord, give us in this world that which is good and in the hereafter that which is good and protect us from the punishment of the fire
[1:50:06] <umjammer_danny> take the baby armor
[1:50:08] <KaiSquared> yo're right i think no one has beaten it yet
[1:50:10] <ghostlikemike> respect jesse refusing the baby armor
[1:50:13] <LilStinker> jesse is in the 10th circle o fhell
[1:50:14] <KaiSquared> but imagine the glory if you're world's first jf
[1:50:14] <MyHeroZer0> can't stay on the ground level i think
[1:50:15] <durkuniverse> he didn't take the baby armor

[1:51:10] <LilacWhimski> JF

[1:51:22] <lingerstink> does bfg ammo respawn?
[1:51:22] <hrkac> maybe you can sneak around them
[1:51:29] <bighowellandpossum> have you tried talking to the guy
[1:51:31] <ghostlikemike> bfg doesnt respawn

[1:56:56] <GenePeanus> so i think when hes doing the move where he shoots lazers our of his head his arms are vulnerable because he puts them down on top of the building and doesnt move them

[2:02:53] <imthinkingdarbys> you aren't doing damage by hitting him in the head, there isn't armor there
[2:03:12] <NugCaleb> this guy probably has a tiny peen
[2:03:17] <KaiSquared> oh wait so you only shoot where there's armor?
[2:03:24] <Sogetastic> yeah
[2:03:32] <Nightbot> If you're a sub, come be a little paypiggy on our Discord! crao https://discord.gg/VraKPdv
[2:03:33] <Sogetastic> doesn't take damage from flesh shots
[2:03:36] <tito_dunkberg> this freaking dude is on the rag or something
[2:03:42] <ghostlikemike> yeah the big thing that says armor sections destryoed tips you off to that
[2:03:44] <LilStinker> they should make you zoom in on the penis with your sniper rifle
[2:03:46] <chrome_chomsky> honestly impressive for that baby
[2:03:50] <turkatim> what's the point of armor if your flesh is invulnerable
[2:04:05] <imthinkingdarbys> yeah you have to break the armor and i'm thinking it'll start another phase of the fight
[2:04:05] <durkuniverse> light him up using the mini gun
[2:04:12] <evilcheeba> My impression of this guy: Ouch, this dude keeps shooting my peen. Ouch!
[2:04:21] <ghostlikemike> shoot him in the tummy and arms!!!!!!!!
[2:04:21] <wanderingass> minigun him jf
[2:04:24] <durkuniverse> you don't need to use the bfg
[2:04:34] <oldnick42> Minigun, maybe with the shield mode to stay alive
[2:04:46] <cowboy_baby42> jf try shooting him some
[2:04:56] <Sogetastic> shoot arms, not peen
[2:05:08] <imthinkingdarbys> broke his tummy armor, now its just the arms
[2:05:19] <oldnick42> That's good stuff.
[2:05:27] <KaiSquared> hey that was cool right?
[2:05:32] <oldnick42> So close!

[2:21:45] <Nightbot> I am one of those people who believe in doing it right the first time. When I purchased my Venus, I bought all of the attachments available. I use the Head Massager for foreplay. If ‘Mr. Happy’ doesn’t want to play I ‘Pump’ up his ego. Then the Receiver strokes me into ecstasy. My partner loves her nipples massaged while she is riding her Sybian. Venus truly does it all! What fantastic products.

[2:21:52] <Nightbot> I walk out here every night with hustle loyalty and respect on my sleeve. That is a credo that I have adopted from the men and women who defend the freedom of this country. We have caught and compromised to a permanent end: Osama. Bin. Laden. This is something tonight. But I feel damn proud to be an American.

What I’m trying to say is, maybe your brain isn’t working either, but that’s OK, because you’re great. PS you need a firmware upgrade in the form of “coffee.”

[2:22:37] <Nightbot> I bought a bundt cake for Jesse about a month ago. When I brought it home, he got irritated because he has been trying to eat healthier. So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today.

[2:23:29] <Cornetto_32> i follow some ps4 fanboys just to laugh at them and they were excited that theres going to be a lot of violence against women because "thats what we anti-SJWs have been asking for"
