[0:08:58] <d_o_n_n_y_> well the meter man walks in our backyard and my dog, Papo, does not like that
[0:09:17] <AxisOfEntropy> locking at 30 might make a better stream?

[0:10:31] <d_o_n_n_y_> i accidentally ate half a moldy croissant and got some bad food poisoning last night
[0:10:36] <spaceshiplaw> all i know is that my dogs eat their own shit so they don't get to be choosy about what food i buy them
[0:11:03] <garyoussy> dog is demanding the high pitched beep
[0:11:05] <teamsolomarx> jesse can u plz do rob and stefan voices and imitate their banter tysm
[0:11:12] <claytondeth> It was the balloon that dropped you earlier, it was Yuletide
[0:11:34] <benghazi_emails> They always stink like shit, but my dogs are picky with food, sometimes they just dont eat if I do only dry
[0:11:37] <misterlunchtime> hi jf

[0:12:41] <misterlunchtime> wheres rob and stefan?
[0:12:50] <garyoussy> rob and stefan are in the upper left corner
[0:12:56] <Down10_> But don't let me get in the way
[0:13:03] <d_o_n_n_y_> i was busy throwing up last night, did jesse discuss cheating on his wife?
[0:13:05] <datamarri> they’re at ben and jerry’s
[0:13:31] <AxisOfEntropy> i'm still sick
[0:13:33] <doubledarkhorse> did you want a greenscreen so that you can cry in front of it?
[0:13:35] <d_o_n_n_y_> stefan and rob are kissing each other
[0:13:39] <sausagehobbit> i am also not feeling well
[0:13:43] <ghostlikemike> i was not feeling well earlier this week
[0:13:46] <GolferInCheeto> Where is steffy and Robert ?
[0:13:48] <benghazi_emails> Those wings are wild!
[0:13:50] <Down10_> I am watching this on my phone from bed
[0:13:52] <tenderstems> I'm fine
[0:13:53] <PsychicBattle> no greenscreen please; your tasteful home decor is a big part of the stream
[0:13:57] <billmaher42069> rob is fulfilling his duties as president of the los angeles DSA and stefan is nude in a forest.
[0:13:59] <garyoussy> going to panda express shortly so that i may also feel badly
[0:13:59] <ghostlikemike> on a date
[0:14:00] <claytondeth> Jesse should counter program Dr Disrespect by talking about how much he loved being faithful to his wife
[0:14:15] <spaceshiplaw> why arent you at the company party for the company you work for
[0:14:34] <sausagehobbit> you said dave and busters its all good
[0:14:38] <drewsgoodtweets> a dogbone(r) of contention
[0:14:39] <Martin_Atchet_> I am glad you are streaming. I have an exam tomorrow and this is very relaxing.
[0:14:41] <Down10_> Your head is literally the size of a pea

[0:15:36] <yarightdude> #NormalHeadJesse
[0:15:41] <Martin_Atchet_> Green screen overlays always look cheap to me. I prefer the letter box.
[0:15:57] <yarightdude> We Jammin'
[0:16:06] <d_o_n_n_y_> jesse your head looks great
[0:16:09] <ghostlikemike> you a wing guy or boneless wing guy

[0:16:33] <claytondeth> I was at bdubs today jf I hope I don't get sick
[0:16:36] <benghazi_emails> Caribbean jerk makes me feel like a traveler at bww
[0:16:38] <d_o_n_n_y_> i just get the chicken tendies at BWW
[0:16:42] <Martin_Atchet_> It’s great to make yourself sick. Pain pigs unite.
[0:16:46] <d_o_n_n_y_> they're really good actually
[0:16:51] <doubledarkhorse> the other day i went to carl's jr and it didn't satisfy my disgusting fat body so i went to taco bell and it def made me sick
[0:16:52] <datamarri> oregon trail
[0:16:52] <Down10_> I'm get Net Neutrality is gone. I need more expensive gatekeepers and middlemen in my life
[0:17:03] <billmaher42069> the steph curry is though
[0:17:13] <Martin_Atchet_> Jesse is that a Kabbalah bracelet on your left wrist?
[0:17:13] <teamsolomarx> Jesse you're set to treasure cove for your game just an FYI
[0:17:26] <misterlunchtime> @stefanandjesse are you worried that streaming alone may lead to the same sort of mental breakdown that resulted from podcasting alone?
[0:17:31] <spaceshiplaw> BWW always seems sticky for some reason
[0:17:32] <umjammer_danny> fortnite servers are down right now i think
[0:17:47] <charlyjee> Can we expect any more Beer Idiot columns in the future?
[0:17:54] <garyoussy> more like epic fail
[0:18:03] <GolferInCheeto> cheer1 cheer1 cheer1 cheer1 cheer1 hey jf is it possible to get Mike on the stream tonight?
[0:18:05] <Axault> BWW more like BBW amirite fellas
[0:18:18] <ghostlikemike> a tender is different than a nugget jesse
[0:18:23] <bluishzulu> hi jesse its me aj im here to watch you
[0:18:23] <dropkickchannel> there was an update today for the winter stuff so it needed to install that stuff
[0:18:31] <d_o_n_n_y_> according to the internet, fortnite servers are down
[0:18:32] <stude> Maybe not so 'epic' after all
[0:18:49] <spaceshiplaw> What sold me is that ted cruz thinks it is good
[0:18:53] <garyoussy> (((jesse farrar)))
[0:18:59] <claytondeth> Classic stream going very smoothly with technology
[0:19:05] <dropkickchannel> when i tried to log in to fortnite just now it says i gotta wait in line so the servers must be busy as heck
[0:19:18] <Chamb3r> pai deserves to have all his internet traffic routed to spankbang.
[0:19:28] <bluishzulu> thoughts on dr disrespect. nows ur chance to shoot to the top @stefanandjesse
[0:19:34] <ghostlikemike> might need to get mike in to save your mental health
[0:19:35] <GolferInCheeto> @connorcgolden I’m wondering the same thing. That’s why I’m trying to get mike on the stream. We don’t want Jesse to become as insane as, say, the joker
[0:19:43] <misterlunchtime> that was a very good episode of YKS but the character development worried me
[0:19:52] <123balls_> If you think you're going to shoot your family, then take a break
[0:20:01] <bluishzulu> its down on the left
[0:20:02] <benghazi_emails> your mods should be able to
[0:20:05] <bluishzulu> on ur streamer page
[0:20:10] <TransLaraCroft> Release the Jf psychotic break solo ep
[0:20:10] <ghostlikemike> unprofessional

[0:20:13] <Axault> #PhoneCall
[0:20:13] <misterlunchtime> speaker phone!
[0:20:14] <Down10_> Maybe you sound sane, and everyone else is crazy
[0:20:19] <billmaher42069> RIP Mike
[0:20:21] <Down10_> Marimba!
[0:20:22] <spaceshiplaw> I think a good bit would be to see how many viewers you can get to watch you have a mental breakdown while not playing video games
[0:20:24] <d_o_n_n_y_> oh, it was a different guy who cheated on his wife, not jesse
[0:20:25] <garyoussy> turn up that lovely mike voice
[0:20:26] <LilStinker> phone stream 2017

[0:21:22] <stude> Let's get some Mike
[0:21:34] <billmaher42069> can we get an update on mike's pillows that he didn't want to talk about on yks?
[0:21:34] <GolferInCheeto> Get mike on the stream for your own dam sanity JF
[0:21:42] <ghostlikemike> tell him to tune into the stream to prove you arent on speaker
[0:21:46] <d_o_n_n_y_> jesse please ask mike how much his pillows cost

[0:23:37] <the_elusive_robert_denby> this is what being a twitch partner is all about
[0:23:40] <stude> Let's get a tearful apology stream
[0:23:43] <LilStinker> can the studio turn up mikes audio

[0:24:08] <claytondeth> Good one mike
[0:24:09] <orchestra_obsessed> I like to spend my precious time on earth watching Jf talk to mike on the phone
[0:24:15] <DeGruber> sounds like a real funny conversation
[0:24:23] <ScubaDoo86> I wonder if Jesse is going to say I love you at the end of the phone call
[0:24:23] <GolferInCheeto> Wife talk
[0:24:33] <umjammer_danny> he didn't say love you
[0:24:35] <claytondeth> Let's hear it for the wife
[0:24:35] <datamarri> jesse farrar white iphone
[0:24:36] <garyoussy> jesse you dont hjave to be shy about telling mike you love him
[0:24:48] <stude> Good stuff
[0:25:04] <Martin_Atchet_> Jesse was absolutely glowing while speaking to mike
[0:25:19] <text_quest> Mike's making one of those calls/videos where he's sucking a big donk and he's lying to his spouse about it
[0:25:23] <rock__solid> are Stefan and Rob out celebrating the death of net neutrality?
[0:25:36] <bluishzulu> why are stefen and rob so quiet @stefanandjesse
