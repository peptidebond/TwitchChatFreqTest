[1:33:23] <scubadoo2188> I got blocked by Chuck Woolery way back in the day, it was before he was even verified, because I told him he wasn't culturally relevant enough to be verified
[1:33:24] <Smanchburger> Wheel of Fortune will be great when Sajak dies
[1:33:24] <pecotaredux> Family Feud always sucked, I liked wheel as a kid
[1:33:25] <tjborg> lots of good dumb guy clips
[1:33:25] <migrainethresher> wheel was worth it just for "on the spot dicespin"
[1:33:31] <depitts> wheel of fortune sucks
[1:33:32] <scrunkbucket> let's play some lingo!
[1:33:36] <dui_haver> too many commercials
[1:33:37] <lipwipwipwip> a chill us
[1:33:39] <sawks> a fun game though
[1:33:41] <SoundAlerts> dwoobo played The Heist for 25 Bits
[1:33:44] <buttbuttpeeman> The price is right is like 5 minutes of actual show on 30 min block. it sucks.
[1:33:44] <bypeheast> woolery sucks but lingo was good
[1:33:46] <pigbart91> everytime someone buys a vowel i wanna die
[1:33:48] <majorleagueyahtzee> a group of pill pushers
[1:33:51] <one_bad_hamburger> absolutely nothing happens
[1:33:52] <andyateacrayon> Self Potato was fucking hilarious
[1:33:54] <farthammer1> Wheel of Fortune is like Steve Harvey standup
[1:33:57] <Max_Hanson> pat sajak is a neocon too
[1:33:59] <pecotaredux> "Bronson, Missouri" is my favorite
[1:33:59] <wastrel333> Trebeck is a good guy, right?
[1:34:00] <AfroGunsou> poop porch
[1:34:02] <chrome_chomsky> its the worst of them but its still makes for funny low brow humour
[1:34:02] <lord_googoo> price is right is a good game show
[1:34:04] <Down10_> I still like Price is Right. Fun show, lively pace, sexy models, Drew Carey. It has it all!
[1:34:04] <BigFakeInHell> I liked on Jeopardy when a lady was talking about nerdcore rap and Alex Trebek called her a loser
[1:34:06] <arcademattchristman> wheel of fortune sucks
[1:34:07] <Smanchburger> Tiny Wheel of Fortune
[1:34:08] <depitts> jeopardy is the only good game show
[1:34:09] <artdamage> wheel of fortune is ok if youre sitting in a room with your entire extended family and the tv is on
[1:34:09] <jeffwiiver> final spin?
[1:34:11] <migrainethresher> jesse must not have seen On The Spot Dicespin
[1:34:11] <tjborg> Tiny Wheel: The game
[1:34:13] <moscow_mule> My favorite blooper was someone saying the answer was "Who you gonna kill, gustbusters"
[1:34:15] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> is marc summers a black lives or blue lives guy do you think
[1:34:15] <FogRawGaming> Jeopardy is the best game show

[1:35:22] <MikeASchneider> nerdcore
[1:35:23] <Down10_> The goofs are funny, but only because the whole show goes quiet
[1:35:23] <ourfriendZin> jeopardy rocks in every way
[1:35:24] <cosmocat69> Nerd core

[1:35:35] <corn_hub> wolf blitzer jeopardy
[1:35:35] <AfroGunsou> i have a nerd ocre
[1:35:38] <andyateacrayon> Trebek is good
[1:35:39] <buttbuttpeeman> Baggage is actually the best game show.
[1:35:39] <ARealLifeBear> Alex Trebek loves roasting contestants, it rocks
[1:35:40] <Down10_> "So… losers."
[1:35:41] <bjork_liker> Where Trebek got cancer was funny
[1:35:41] <freudianslipandslide> jeopardy has the classic pedophile bit
[1:35:43] <Aptiman> achilles, let me get the fajitas please and a margarita!

[1:36:20] <considerthetetrapod> oof
[1:36:23] <crab_wife> trebek is like insane tho
[1:36:24] <CerberusSystem> i love the LPC bit where someone asks to speak to his manager and he connects them to alex trebek
[1:36:24] <DrOrpheusMD> I think trebek picks the stories to embarrass the people
[1:36:26] <sawks> i don't know what i would say either
[1:36:26] <MikeASchneider> imagine jesse describing literally his job to alex trebek
[1:36:27] <AfroGunsou> jesse would tell teh koger story
[1:36:27] <biggest_fans> Jesse would talk about the crochet monster truck tweet
[1:36:28] <bjork_liker> JF guested on Doughboys
[1:36:29] <andyateacrayon> what the fuck
[1:36:31] <migrainethresher> @GoOffKings you have to watch that wheel of fortune clip
[1:36:37] <andyateacrayon> he's too good
[1:36:41] <EpochError> @GoOffKings jesse you could talk about going to the store
[1:36:43] <mmmmspaghetti> jf using his cell phone to cheat on jeopardy
[1:36:44] <bypeheast> you tell the producers a bunch of anecdotes and they pull them on you from a list
[1:36:51] <Down10_> lol
[1:36:55] <BroPair> has arthur chu shuffled off this mortal coil yet
[1:36:56] <andyateacrayon> Jeopardy rules JF smh
[1:36:56] <serpentine666> arthur chu was fun on jeopardy, shame about him irl
[1:36:57] <hawesome237> yes

[1:37:13] <tjborg> jeopardy is fast
[1:37:16] <markfartman7> wheel of 4chan is what i thought rob said
[1:37:16] <pigbart91> thats the funniest part

[1:37:20] <Land_Phil> wheel sof 4chan?
[1:37:20] <smellytacos1> its so you can judge them
[1:37:21] <andyateacrayon> the anecdotes are like 1 minute long total
[1:37:21] <tjborg> true
[1:37:23] <AfroGunsou> @Down10_ he actually seems quite good
[1:37:25] <arcademattchristman> im not recording jeopardy man cmon
[1:37:29] <cosmocat69> I like ken Jennings
[1:37:31] <bypeheast> ken jennings does seem always on the verge of being canceled but hasnt tipped yet
[1:37:31] <DrOrpheusMD> I do skip them they make me cringe
[1:37:31] <markc> Ken Jennings is good I'm pretty sure
[1:37:32] <hawesome237> wheel of fortune introductions are 10x worse and the jeopardy ones are bad
[1:37:32] <chrome_chomsky> sometimes but not all
[1:37:34] <farthammer1> Jesse on Jeopardy! "Yeah so I once beat the new Doom" (Alex stares at him blankly)
[1:37:34] <wastrel333> Ken Jennings is funny
[1:37:35] <bigtigg> Ken rocks actually
[1:37:35] <sawks> ken jennings rules
[1:37:37] <Down10_> Yeah, I liked him. I was hoping he wasn't cancelled
[1:37:39] <dui_haver> it's great to hate watch
[1:37:40] <JoeBushDotNet> No that Chu fellow seems to have human interaction down just fine
[1:37:40] <arcademattchristman> watch it when its on its like sports its gotta be live
[1:37:42] <MarsIsWaiting> we can thank jeopardy for ian miles
[1:37:42] <sawks> very good politics
[1:37:43] <markovblanket> that does make you smart
[1:37:44] <andyateacrayon> Ken Jennings is not getting cancelled
[1:37:45] <migrainethresher> @GoOffKings please https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npgzz42IEiE it's unreal
[1:37:45] <pigbart91> recording on tv is for movies only
[1:37:50] <bigtigg> good and anti-cop
[1:37:51] <djsterndad> yes
[1:37:52] <depitts> the problem is you only 15 seconds, not enough time to tell a good story
[1:37:53] <mukau> what would the kings jeporady anecdote be?
[1:37:54] <bypeheast> yes
[1:37:55] <BroPair> I thionk so

[1:37:57] <markfartman7> there's not time for bullshit on the wheel
[1:37:59] <andyateacrayon> yeah they always just say how many kids and shit they have
[1:38:02] <DrOrpheusMD> you say your job I think
[1:38:03] <cosmocat69> I keep meaning to watch the Arthur Chu doc
[1:38:08] <Down10_> Ken Jennings wrote really long take on the final episode of the Sopranos that is a MUST READ
[1:38:10] <bypeheast> james holzhauer
[1:38:12] <cosmocat69> The bartender?
[1:38:12] <mmmmspaghetti> got em
[1:38:12] <farthammer1> Arthur Chu

[1:38:15] <farthammer1> ?
[1:38:15] <tjborg> oh!
[1:38:17] <serpentine666> arthur chu
[1:38:17] <wastrel333> the gambler dude?
[1:38:21] <Megaspel> oh yeah arthur chu
[1:38:22] <hawesome237> It's just very boiler plate stuff of WoF
[1:38:23] <headlesspresident> hahagaha
[1:38:25] <reednich> austin?
[1:38:25] <BroPair> that guy sucks
[1:38:26] <andyateacrayon> Austin Rogers probably
[1:38:26] <sawks> yeah i couldn't stand holzhauer, everyone was so horny for him
[1:38:29] <BroPair> rob is right

[1:38:32] <markc> haha
[1:38:36] <pigbart91> arthur chu sucks so much
[1:38:36] <andyateacrayon> Arthur Chu is terrible lol
[1:38:40] <BreenIsGod> Austin Rogers would be a good QB name
[1:38:41] <reednich> couldnt stand austin
[1:38:42] <andyateacrayon> Rogers was just annoying
[1:38:45] <Down10_> Arthur Chu is a legit insane person
[1:38:45] <pigbart91> ken jennings should beat his ass
[1:38:45] <depitts> austin Rogers got on my fucking nerves
[1:38:45] <europeansheep> his documentary is so sad
[1:38:46] <bypeheast> colby burnett is the goat jeopardy guy
[1:38:46] <EpochError> athur chu doc was so grim
[1:38:48] <beef__woman> that dude ugly as hell
[1:38:48] <buttbuttpeeman> what are those?
[1:38:53] <patbicks> Arthur Chu was finally knocked out in the round with the category “Caring for Your Wife”
[1:38:53] <sawks> was austin rogers the snapping guy
[1:38:54] <headlesspresident> aww I loved watching Austin how sad haha
[1:38:58] <markc> nuts and meat, keto friendly
[1:38:59] <andyateacrayon> I liked Holzhauer cause he kinda accepted he was annoying but he's also like a fucking genius
[1:39:00] <dunkaccino> Washington DC tv market has jeopardy on after wheel of fortune and its the main reason that place is fucked
[1:39:01] <cosmocat69> I love that Jennings beat Holzhauer at his own game while humiliating Brad Rutter. It was the last good thing to happen
[1:39:02] <JoeBushDotNet> Austin Rodgers was so good for the Packers in that super bowl though
[1:39:03] <AfroGunsou> jesse can you please give me some of those meat snacks
[1:39:03] <serpentine666> colby rules

[1:50:09] <tjborg> Sonic is just Cook-Out for nerds
[1:50:10] <arcademattchristman> the peep this out judging criteria is genuinely insane and thats cool
[1:50:10] <biggest_fans> When i was in high school sonic had a great chicken strip sandwich for $.69
[1:50:12] <hawesome237> Needs to be
[1:50:12] <BreenIsGod> he should use Chewie's son, Lumpy, in a video
[1:50:15] <owlyoop> i think ian should mention the price 5 more times
[1:50:16] <JoeBushDotNet> PREACH
[1:50:17] <Your_Boy_Soko> I dont think this guy likes the price
[1:50:20] <MikeASchneider> stefan did you show john this yet
[1:50:21] <nasty_nasty_nasty> insane to say that that isn't good value for 2.50. freak opinion

[1:50:46] <pigbart91> i kinda agree that its not a good deal. I can get a mcdouble for the same price
[1:50:47] <Down10_> that price, it's so pointy
[1:50:48] <myslef100> puts on his thinking face when he bites.

[1:51:37] <BroPair> dumbass
[1:51:38] <MikeASchneider> so what were his complaints here? it's too small?
[1:51:38] <Down10_> cruel rating
[1:51:41] <ShroomsofDoom> chicken was bad. would have covered this
[1:51:42] <zednaught> his anti-sonic bias is frankly disgusting
[1:51:42] <vanapps> psychopath
[1:51:43] <tjborg> omg
[1:51:43] <machopineapple> he looks like shit. he's really let himself go
[1:51:46] <hrkac> the regular chicken sammies at sonic are like 4-5 dollars the fuck is he talking about
[1:51:46] <sawks> fast food reviewer who doesnt like mayo, fucking dumbass
[1:51:47] <Source_Force> they're overpriced because back in the day a sandwich that size would cost 10 cents
[1:51:48] <coolermaster88> they're just fucking pickles dude!!
[1:51:48] <ShroomsofDoom> he's just staring at a timer
[1:51:48] <hug_nicemann> the entire review was a single sentence. it's like william faulkner
[1:51:48] <europeansheep> for peep
[1:51:49] <artdamage> not a fan of mayo surprise
[1:51:51] <Down10_> for only $2? That was a great deal
[1:51:56] <SwoopaLoop00> price point
[1:51:57] <vanapps> no bueno
[1:52:01] <uoenodoe> he builds up from 0
[1:52:04] <sawks> price point
[1:52:04] <IncrediDick> a literal poo poo could get higher than 3.5
[1:52:04] <andyateacrayon> no bueno price point
[1:52:04] <markfartman7> this stream is hell rn
[1:52:07] <BigFakeInHell> He's saying the spicy ranch and the pickles are the only thing that gave it any points at all
[1:52:09] <haterdeluxe> Takes longer to hear the review than it does to eat the sandwich
[1:52:13] <MikeASchneider> stay frosty!!!!

[1:54:06] <SwoopaLoop00> tough price point there
[1:54:07] <farthammer1> I almost bought my first house in Campbell. They have a GREAT farmer's market
[1:54:07] <BreenIsGod> $6.04
[1:54:09] <dumassolay> thats a good price point
[1:54:10] <swearholes> Joey is posted on top of a Wendy's right now
[1:54:10] <Down10_> it's okay for SF, the most expensive place on earth
[1:54:12] <buttbuttpeeman> @eyeonicdj STAN A LEGO
[1:54:12] <CarltonBanksEsq> that taco looks like dog shit
[1:54:12] <hawesome237> Still thinking about when Joey told the worker to make his slushie pretty and tie dye
[1:54:13] <Land_Phil> for 6 bucks you can get like 10 fucking tacos in TJ
[1:54:15] <DrOrpheusMD> even a high end taco is not over five
[1:54:15] <pigbart91> in LA I have to assume you can get like dollar tacos that rule
[1:54:15] <AfroGunsou> too expansive of taco
[1:54:16] <andyateacrayon> JF is peep this out confirmed

[1:54:27] <SamTheNannerMan> that isn't that big
[1:54:28] <Timb0nic> He shouts out the location like 20 times
[1:54:28] <AfroGunsou> expensive. not so expansibe
[1:54:29] <SwoopaLoop00> wewewewewewew price point
[1:54:29] <andyateacrayon> yeah that is too much
[1:54:29] <itsmikeo> Four cents too much!!
[1:54:30] <ourfriendZin> 6 bucks will get you like 4 tacos at del taco
[1:54:33] <migrainethresher> this feels more like a cry for help than usual
[1:54:34] <bypeheast> its huge tho
[1:54:35] <farthammer1> Jesse that's my old area. It's a fancy South Bay Area town. $6 sounds right for that location.
[1:54:36] <MikeASchneider> where's this from
[1:54:36] <smellytacos1> muchachos please
[1:54:39] <artdamage> joeys gonna run over a protestor after this
[1:54:39] <dreww> taco bravo yelp reviews: "So I called into this place like 4 times to place an order and every time they would pick up than hang up on me and the 4th time they picked up the phone and just left it on and didn't even take my order I was on the phone for 5 min waiting for someone to answer me I'm never trying to order from this place aging"
[1:54:40] <the___community> wewewewe

[1:54:48] <andyateacrayon> oh no joey
[1:54:50] <AfroGunsou> thats a $4 dollar taco at best

[1:55:10] <vanapps> i can get a better taco down the street for under $1.50
[1:55:11] <andyateacrayon> eat the taco king
[1:55:16] <Down10_> That's not a good price for a single taco, but for 2 it's good
[1:55:16] <AfroGunsou> man this makes me want some tacos though
[1:55:18] <mcdogsman> In the Bay Area $6 is the price for 1 food item
[1:55:18] <farthammer1> Jesse a house in Campbell that is 1500 square feet would cost close to $1,000,000 now
[1:55:22] <sawks> weewewe wee wee woo
[1:55:22] <LaOwlLOL> when he rolls up to his taco bell drive through they know he's going a review right?

[1:55:29] <DrOrpheusMD> does look good though
[1:55:32] <dreww> taco bravo yelp review: "Quite literally the worst Mexican food I've ever had in my life. I think they must have leased a building from an old taqueria. I guess I wasn't aware that this place is not authentic. I ordered 3 soft tacos, with various meat styles. I didn't like any of my food, and serving "hot" salsa out of a coffee thermos is not a good look. I will not return."
[1:55:33] <Timb0nic> He shorts out a couple times
[1:55:37] <thaneofcawdor> got that cheesy style dementia
[1:55:38] <usernamehaver> this is disgusting

[1:56:57] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:56:58] <dreww> taco bravo yelp review: i personally worked here a lil bit ago and while the food is okay, the acctual inside is truly gross. they never mop up anything, never date anything, dont properly scrub meat pans and will lightly go over the pan with a sponge and dip it in bleach all the while seeing crud and burnt on meat. then proceed to throw it back on the stove and cook more meat straining the fat in a bucket on the floor."
[1:56:59] <ShroomsofDoom> joey close your damn mouth

[2:12:09] <MikeASchneider> I walked into a Starbucks about a year ago, little kid behind the counter. I go, "Yeah, give me a regular." "A regular what?" "Coffee." "What flavor?" "Coffee-flavored coffee." I'll stick that menu right up your ass, kid! Menu... coffee doesn't need a menu, it needs a cup, that's all it needs! Maybe a saucer underneath the cup, that's it!
[2:12:11] <fishclamps1> dennis Leary king

[2:13:27] <AfroGunsou> imagine having a normal human conversation with joey about like the weather
[2:13:29] <cn_monoxide> Whether you’re a salesman or mechanic or wash boy you get access to most of the cars on the lot

[2:13:56] <migrainethresher> i prefer menudo milkshake to chorizo
[2:13:57] <Timb0nic> Yeah all slushies are good
[2:13:59] <buttbuttpeeman> Get in for a test drive and the car smells like someone ordered off the Taco Bell and KFC menu.
[2:13:59] <TaintEnthusiast> awkward when you're eating a pound of raw chorizo in the break room and joey's like "oh, I already had one of those"
[2:14:06] <chillBuu> the joey compilation tom plays sometimes is so bad

[2:15:30] <scubadoo2188> they sell shirts of that shit
[2:15:36] <harryhas29> i'm always characterizing tho
[2:15:37] <scrunkbucket> @uoenodoe i checked and there was just a Bill Mitchell retweet
[2:15:47] <buttbuttpeeman> If the Nordiques are in NHL image the Connecticut Whalers in too?
[2:15:47] <MikeASchneider> saying fuck you after you have yielded your time is great
[2:15:53] <mukau> did you see her with that bible??????? bro!!!!
[2:15:58] <scubadoo2188> they sell nancy pelosi shirts with that awful characterize line that make no sense
[2:16:05] <its_doggety> well her bible thing did make trump resign so
[2:16:09] <Down10_> Muh bahbul
[2:16:15] <Nightbot> Hey, if you've got Amazon Prime, you can link it up to your Twitch account and get a free stream subscription! Which you can then use on this stream! Pretty neat!
[2:16:16] <sawks> ya
[2:16:18] <TaintEnthusiast> COVID is disrupting the adrenochrome supply chain, it's not good for Nancy
[2:16:22] <headlesspresident> yeah
[2:16:23] <BigFakeInHell> "Do not characterize the strength that I bring" is soccer mom shit
[2:16:36] <headlesspresident> Christian jihad
[2:16:40] <uoenodoe> he's signaling to them
[2:16:43] <BaconWake89> I mean Hitler liked holding up a bible and that went a direction for sure
[2:16:44] <BreenIsGod> but it was so awkward and weird
[2:16:50] <dogwontstopnuttingHELP> stefan go to Kentucky and you'll know
[2:16:51] <biggest_fans> It's a sign stefan
[2:16:53] <pigbart91> rob is right appalachian people are insane
[2:17:07] <headlesspresident> A Bible. not even his
[2:17:09] <artdamage> its A bible
[2:17:13] <Down10_> it's creepy as hell
[2:17:16] <bypeheast> equal
[2:17:16] <andyateacrayon> mark halperin(!) did
[2:17:21] <SamTheNannerMan> equal
[2:17:25] <BreenIsGod> even better it's a Sarah Cooper video
[2:17:25] <AfroGunsou> trump could wipe his butt after a diarrhea with pages of teh bible and some thumpers would be like "hes touching the bible and thats good to me"
[2:17:30] <BaconWake89> Rob should watch that video, it's hilarious
[2:17:31] <vanapps> he likes them all
[2:17:32] <dogwontstopnuttingHELP> trump couldn't say it because it was Ecclesiastes
[2:17:35] <Source_Force> ah well, nevertheless
[2:17:37] <NugCaleb> probably... equal
[2:17:41] <corn_hub> remember the two corinthians shit?
[2:17:42] <Land_Phil> yeah it doesnt matter those evangelical freaks will follow him no matter what
[2:17:43] <headlesspresident> changing a tire lmao
[2:17:52] <bigtigg> it's A Bible
[2:17:53] <moscow_mule> The secret is, Evangelicals do no know the bible either so it doesn't matterif he doesn't.
[2:17:55] <Down10_> Stand in front of this oncoming train
[2:17:55] <pigbart91> i wanna see trump shoot a gun
[2:17:55] <chrome_chomsky> dont eat this child
[2:17:58] <Timb0nic> Just like Jesse does
[2:17:59] <drill_the_grass> then they will say it's because he's rich and he doesn't need to know how to change one
[2:18:12] <WretchedNerd> Laika was a nasty dog! Bye Bye!
