I will be using it at least once a week. I will be ordering lots more lube.

[0:25:03] <naffologist> gotta have the filler, specifically for the driver's ed episode
[0:25:04] <drill_the_grass> imperfect cell, are we talking about the battery in the samsung note?

[0:27:49] <farthammer1> @Sogetastic It got too repetitive too fast. Vegeta lets the enemy power up like 3 times and screws everything up 3 times. Goku transports Cell to Kai's planet and blows him up and Cell still comes back...It had good moments but too many dumb moments.

[1:02:16] <FatCardinals> I fucking hate cumming
[1:02:16] <Down10_> The feeling of barfing is not good
[1:02:18] <one_bad_hamburger> diarreha is over really quick so whatever
[1:02:22] <nutwrinkle_> COOM
[1:02:23] <jamesinhifi> peeing is so good
[1:02:23] <dgbnr> pee is the cousin of cum. those two are in cahoots
[1:02:24] <RadishGiant> tonsil stones
[1:02:24] <MikeASchneider> barf feels good after but only like 10 minutes later
[1:02:24] <Juicerosmith> if I never had to wake up to pee again, that'd rule.
[1:02:24] <TheBigAristotle69420> pissing when you really have to piss is the best feeling
[1:02:24] <huckmedaddy69> I hate barfing
[1:02:25] <ChrisKyleMacLachlan> this reminds me too much of sunday school
[1:02:26] <tuffghost> diarrhea sucks
[1:02:26] <brgrho> Yes. Cum is the one that doesn't feel good.
[1:02:26] <NHLPlayerToreyKrug> barf feels good the moment after you do it for exactly one second
[1:02:26] <McCainFlightSchool> barfing is awful
[1:02:27] <big_time_goofus> I have diarrhea every day
[1:02:28] <BUNCHOFCATS> if i could never have to piss again i would give one trillion dollars
[1:02:28] <PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Settle Down by Counterpoint Culture -> https://prtzl.to/QVH71ADDS6
[1:02:29] <drhazzard> hate to barf
[1:02:29] <NugCaleb> pissing is a great excuse to leave for a minute
[1:02:29] <dmlat> i wouldnt call diarrhea a good feeling but it's better than barfing
[1:02:30] <one_bad_hamburger> barf in your nose is the worst
[1:02:31] <BroPair> well
[1:02:33] <foygus_> i want all of them
[1:02:33] <JoeBushDotNet> I forcibly lost the ability to vomit after a Heller's Miotomy in 2010 so I have to pick barfing :(
[1:02:34] <eboe> diarrhea does not feel good what
[1:02:36] <brgrho> Cumming hurts so bad.
[1:02:37] <completebreakfast> the relief after the barf is good
[1:02:37] <DaneKnight> barf is one of the funniest words
[1:02:38] <heycorvidae> sort throat and stomach
[1:02:42] <SocialistWaluigi> yeah barfing makes me feel so much fucking better
[1:02:42] <heycorvidae> sore*
[1:02:43] <ARealLifeBear> oh yeah, the after-barf is heavenly
[1:02:44] <johntherun06> Barf sucks WHILE it’s happening, but then when you’re finished you get those sweet sweet endorphins
[1:02:47] <cccrys> barfing doesn't happen as often so it's okay
[1:02:48] <NHLPlayerToreyKrug> ROB IS CORRECT
[1:02:48] <zany_antics> you can still taste the barf in your mouth. no thanks
[1:02:49] <ChrisKyleMacLachlan> acid burned throat and mouth is so fucking bad
[1:02:50] <migrainethresher> i feel immortal immediately after barfing
[1:02:52] <Sogetastic> Rob is right
[1:02:53] <BloodWorms> that's not better than nutting though
[1:02:54] <serpentine666> you feel better than before but the feeling is still fucked
[1:02:57] <borg412> nothing tastes as good as skinny feels though
[1:02:58] <eyeonicDJ> u dont taste piss!
[1:02:58] <BUNCHOFCATS> i have to piss so much it can fuck off
[1:02:59] <Down10_> Diarrhea is not a good time or a pretty sight, but it better than barfing
[1:02:59] <BroPair> I'm sorry. is rob saying barfing is better than cumming
[1:02:59] <mrspree15> Stefan has never barfed
[1:02:59] <tompeppre> barfing can save your life
[1:03:01] <McCainFlightSchool> a really good nutt is the best
[1:03:02] <durkuniverse> barfing is hard to hold in
[1:03:02] <BroPair> think about thus
[1:03:02] <sawks> bad diarrhea fucking sucks though
[1:03:02] <eyeonicDJ> its that easy!
[1:03:03] <yeeeeeeboiiii> ?
[1:03:05] <jamesinhifi> some people like seeing barf and theyd be upset but barf gots to go
[1:03:09] <machopineapple> No
[1:03:12] <bjork_liker> Just took a big piss. Feels great
[1:03:14] <NugCaleb> did Stefan just say that pissing feels better than cumming?
[1:03:15] <unitluna> barf gets up your nostrils after you barf
[1:03:18] <khajimak> taking a piss when you wake up is the best feeling
[1:03:18] <lil_pookie_c> it feels good to coom
[1:03:19] <Hotsquint> spew or blow chunks
[1:03:20] <tompeppre> what if you swallow poison by accident
[1:03:20] <SamTheNannerMan> barf fucking sucks
[1:03:20] <LilacWhimski> you feel so absolultely terrible leading up to barfing and actually barfing is miserable
[1:03:21] <bloviated> I've barfed on purpose, I haven't diarhead on purpose.
[1:03:25] <theoriginalferg> barf burns the throat
[1:03:25] <buttson> barf sticks in your throat and sinus
[1:03:26] <mister_snipes_> smelling cum makes me want to cum
[1:03:27] <Down10_> What if smelling cum made you cum
[1:03:28] <BUNCHOFCATS> waking up in the night to piss fuck that

[1:03:30] <nutwrinkle_> Love cooming
[1:03:32] <funloverhaha> Why did you hold your piss in for 6 hours?
[1:03:33] <ThatGardenWeasel> cum gotta go, the rest could kill you if you couldn't do it
[1:03:34] <howintensive> i feel the worst after cumming
[1:03:34] <one_bad_hamburger> lol
[1:03:35] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:03:35] <Timb0nic> unpopular opinion: barf rules
[1:03:36] <LaOwlLOL> coom not going anywhere
[1:03:36] <WheezTheSnus> barf sucks. broken capillaries, headache, sore throat from a rough barf session sucks

[1:03:43] <anuscolon> when i smell piss i wanna cum
[1:03:45] <brutalism4ever> you hate to see this kind of discourse if you're a barf fan
[1:03:45] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> Stefan likes barf more than he likes pasta
[1:03:46] <zany_antics> sometimes when you think about piss it makes you need to piss
[1:03:46] <hectordoink> also barfing damages your insides on the way out
[1:03:48] <h_dub_v_lit> It's actually that barfing releases dopamine and other neurotransmitters
[1:03:49] <heycorvidae> love to cum

[1:07:07] <bjork_liker> Puking sucks
[1:07:08] <eboe> the pitcher has chose cumming
[1:07:10] <anuscolon> So Rob loves barfing, Jesse is shitting 3+ times a day,
[1:07:12] <BroPair> it can be proved using organic chemistry that rob is wrong
[1:07:13] <WheezTheSnus> cumming is the best, but taking a nice solid shit where you feel totally emptied out is amazing
[1:07:13] <egregiousfuqup> if you are serious about this, therapy is a wise choice
[1:07:13] <considerthetetrapod> if i cum from pulling off i just immediately go to bed
[1:07:17] <tuffghost> what
[1:07:18] <NHLPlayerToreyKrug> that's interesting

[1:07:20] <bloviated> what?
[1:07:22] <ya_boi_moes> what
[1:07:23] <jazzisking> what
[1:07:23] <hectordoink> hahahah that's good
[1:07:23] <JoeBushDotNet> I do that with pooping
[1:07:23] <buttson> it's cause you're sick before you barf, but you're just horned up before you nut off. being horned up is frustrating but not bad
[1:07:24] <MikeASchneider> i think rob does do that
[1:07:25] <sawks> what
[1:07:26] <yeeeeeeboiiii> ?
[1:07:26] <Chexoid> if jacking off was your like 9-5 job would you get sick of it eventually
[1:07:28] <theoriginalferg> wtf is stefan talking about
[1:07:28] <ya_boi_moes> what dude
[1:07:30] <johnfromcincinnati> that's fucked up
[1:07:31] <funloverhaha> Aftermath of cum depends on if you have a partner or were on your own
[1:07:31] <coldslaw69> i think of good poops to make myself poop
[1:07:31] <swearholes> I don't do that when I cum

[1:07:34] <MarsIsWaiting> throwing up is the worst thing in the entire world
[1:07:37] <tuffghost> that's insane
[1:07:39] <BroPair> cumming releases chemicals like oxytocin. barf tastes like shit

[1:11:23] <Its_Endless_Mike> jacking off on ssris is like putting shitty microwave chicken nuggets in the oven and waiting 30 minutes to eat them
[1:11:25] <Number6DogMom> These are lies
[1:11:25] <tacobellass> True
[1:11:26] <NHLPlayerToreyKrug> saw someone do a cum video when they had covid 19, haven't gone back to their channel
[1:11:26] <mister_snipes_> i jacked out a stone

[1:11:33] <rodzirvin> Rob, it gets rid of HORNINESS
[1:11:34] <robertforry> cumming saved my life
[1:11:37] <sawks> sore throat is the worst fucking part of being sick
[1:11:39] <chrome_chomsky> if its the only one you do optionally and youve been opting to do it for decades, you enjoy it
[1:11:41] <spenceredelstei> what if you swallow a load then you puke up some cum
[1:11:41] <WolfofWallmarket> cumming can create life
[1:11:41] <migrainethresher> i can tell i'm getting sick when the nut doesn't feel right
[1:11:41] <nutwrinkle_> You’re really just puking out your dick
[1:11:42] <hi_im_doug> nothing beats being hung over and drinking a whole bunch of water and puking out mostly water. now thats the stuff
[1:11:42] <depitts> cumming can create life!
[1:11:45] <one_bad_hamburger> lol
[1:11:46] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:11:46] <bjork_liker> Jerking off saved my life in high school when i was suicidal

[1:11:46] <BroPair> enjoy it rob
[1:11:48] <prawnran> hahah
[1:11:50] <biggest_fans> Robs number 1 is barfing
[1:11:53] <gweeedo> number three on robs list
[1:11:54] <masterpo3> I jacked off on citalopram and my dick just coughed when i came'
[1:11:55] <tacobellass> What about a penis full of poison gotta get it out
[1:11:58] <jazzisking> john would agree with you at first but then get extremely exasperated by this point
[1:11:59] <hometownmarkup> number cum
[1:11:59] <MarsIsWaiting> poll one-sided
[1:12:02] <mediumlizard> Robs gotta be trolling
[1:12:03] <lipwipwipwip> now cumming with a bullet is something else
[1:12:07] <AfroGunsou> easy poll
[1:12:13] <thebigragu420> cum is life , life is cum
[1:12:14] <completebreakfast> you said it was pooping like 2 minutes ago you liar
[1:12:16] <umjammer_danny> all this because of db
[1:12:16] <farthammer1> Neil Degrasse Tyson just tweeted that Einstein came up with the Theory of Relativity after he came on the leg of his own purple suit
[1:12:17] <BroPair> consider this: if nutting was NOT the best, humanity would not have been able to propagate itself. ALL LIFE wouldn't have been able to do that
[1:12:17] <RadishGiant> But what about farting?
[1:12:20] <GhoulSzn22> the worst side effect of cumming is making sometimes it makes a new human
[1:12:21] <anuscolon> Rob left to cum, economists call that "revealed preference"
[1:12:23] <rodzirvin> Also, puking fucks up your stomach and esophagus
[1:12:24] <coach_mike_dan_tony> he's burned out on cumming
[1:12:25] <NugCaleb> We gotta do something about Rob
[1:12:25] <MikeASchneider> poll too easy
[1:12:29] <BroPair> I dont
[1:12:29] <BloodWorms> rob's anti nutting stance is unbelievable to me
[1:12:32] <migrainethresher> his penis
[1:12:32] <GooseDerricksoN> cumming rocks
[1:12:33] <McCainFlightSchool> yeah cumming from his penis
[1:12:36] <WheezTheSnus> cumming being the best is the reason for all life on earth
[1:12:38] <chrome_chomsky> from his peepee!
[1:12:42] <bloviated> The feeling after barfing is stability
[1:12:42] <one_bad_hamburger> its not good, you just feel normal
[1:12:48] <johntherun06> I also understand where Rob is coming from - his penis!
[1:12:52] <headlesspresident> puking is very bad for your teeth too though. cumming is not
[1:12:54] <nutwrinkle_> Cumming 2020
[1:12:54] <coldslaw69> imagine if you barfed cum
[1:12:57] <thebigragu420> cum is just dick vomit
[1:12:59] <tuffghost> i've puked like twice in my life, too small a sample size to rank
[1:13:02] <tacobellass> Sometimes cumming is hard
[1:13:04] <BroPair> the relief from puking is not as good as any of the other ones providing relief. that feeling after taking a huge shit? or a piss?
[1:13:05] <Megaspel> if you dont shit you'll die
[1:13:06] <theoriginalferg> like rod Stewart
[1:13:07] <sunnohnine> You don’t barf cum?
[1:13:09] <barefootandpreg> I cry every time i barf and only sometimes when I cum
[1:13:09] <bloviated> Between puking and diarhea, I've only puked on purpose.

[1:13:12] <farthammer1> Would you rather cum barf or barf cum????????
[1:13:12] <coldslaw69> well
[1:13:14] <Aptiman> cumming is barfing out of your dick
[1:13:16] <goodfriendjake> i siimply believe mr bro pair should get on the horn and yell at you
[1:13:17] <Megaspel> you might also die if you dont barf in some situations
[1:13:21] <headlesspresident> barf cum
[1:13:23] <migrainethresher> @coldslaw69 seems like the compromise position is self sucking until you puke
[1:13:23] <NHLPlayerToreyKrug> i'd rather barf cum
[1:13:24] <coldslaw69> firing pieces of tomatoes out of your dick
[1:13:26] <boogercousins> Arguing whether or not cumming feels good
[1:13:29] <tuffghost> shitting is terrible
[1:13:30] <sawks> barf cum for sure
[1:13:30] <heycorvidae> wrong

[1:13:42] <thebigragu420> imagine coming shit
[1:13:43] <biggest_fans> shitting rules 98% of the time
[1:13:43] <naffologist> it absolutely depends on the shit
[1:13:43] <starkimified> The thing about barfing is that it's rarely just one and done. There's a lot of retching

[1:14:50] <foygus_> when youre standing in line in kroger and you can just freely sneeze--thats the best
[1:14:51] <NugCaleb> I love suffering mortal wounds
[1:14:51] <gweeedo> can we make a tough one gotta go for kinds of shits
[1:14:54] <headlesspresident> cracking your back beats everything
[1:14:55] <sawks> a good yawn is better than a sneeze
[1:14:57] <rodzirvin> Specially if a lot of snot comes out, sneezing kicks ass
[1:14:58] <LaOwlLOL> sneezing is good, but cooming is sneezing for the balls and cock.
[1:14:59] <machopineapple> it sucks. barfing sucks. diarrhea sucks.
[1:14:59] <bluestraveler666> naruto hills
[1:15:04] <johnfromcincinnati> it's great when you have a high fiber diet and drop perfect turds

[1:15:08] <nutwrinkle_> I sneeze 73 times every time I sneeze
[1:15:10] <coach_mike_dan_tony> I hate sneezing because satan slips in every time

[1:15:20] <rodzirvin> Blowing your nose also rocks
[1:15:23] <brgrho> If Stefan had 5 minutes to live, he'd opt to shit instead of cum.
[1:15:25] <one_bad_hamburger> lets get this straight
[1:15:26] <bloviated> I actually don't like talking about symptoms because it psychosomatically gives me the symptoms.
[1:15:30] <ourfriendZin> pissing is cool

[1:17:17] <cottoneyejoeexotic> blowing nose. zit can leave a scar
[1:17:17] <McCainFlightSchool> blowing your nose is way better
[1:17:18] <OohMamma420> zit
[1:17:18] <its_doggety> clearing out a stuffed nose is definitely better
[1:17:19] <Sogetastic> popping zit
[1:17:22] <TaintEnthusiast> nose is necessary, zit is ill-advised
[1:17:23] <jamesinhifi> nose
[1:17:23] <johnfromcincinnati> draining a cyst
[1:17:23] <bloviated> the relief of being able to breathe clearly trumps nearly everything
[1:17:25] <hi_im_doug> no way. leave the zits alone
[1:17:26] <GFunkDeluxe> Nose when your head is full of snot
[1:17:27] <one_bad_hamburger> the nose blow with the green snot is insanely good
[1:17:28] <NHLPlayerToreyKrug> that's where cumming comes in though
[1:17:28] <toilet_noise> popping zits is bad
[1:17:31] <JoeBushDotNet> pissing your pants or giving a big hug to somebody you love

[1:17:51] <howintensive> what part of food poisoning is worse- diarrhea or puking
[1:17:52] <buttson> food poisoning puke pushes it out of the #1 spot
[1:17:52] <LilacWhimski> hangover puke or incredibly drunk puke is good, all othersa re awful
[1:17:55] <bobricebobrice> showrunner
[1:17:55] <brutalism4ever> really not willing to give up my morning shower snot rocket
[1:17:58] <migrainethresher> pissing the bed or wet dream
[1:17:58] <coldslaw69> the barf got you horny admit it
[1:18:00] <depitts> with cum, are we talking jacking off or sex?
[1:18:01] <CerberusSystem> so rob has said he cums every day, does he get himself to barf every day? if not why not?
[1:18:03] <big_time_goofus> Or you could be an alcoholic and drink vodka out of the bottle and feel like puking
[1:18:05] <rodzirvin> Stefan did it at the same time?
[1:18:06] <WretchedNerd> Jesse, good one. I know no one else got it
[1:18:07] <bobricebobrice> showrunner guy did that hangover bad movie
[1:18:08] <Down10_> are you still talking about this grossout stuff?
[1:18:09] <NugCaleb> I felt so sick I made love to myself
[1:18:11] <bobricebobrice> mazin
[1:18:12] <ShieldRJaguar> Barfing is the worst cause of the residual taste in nose and mouth
[1:18:15] <anuscolon> brutal swings tbh
[1:18:16] <big_time_goofus> Not that I’ve ever done that
[1:18:18] <rushlimbaughstumors> oooohhhhhh shit, when did rob come back?? welcome back, rob!
[1:18:21] <winzigwinsbig> this is the stupidest conversation in the history of the stream
[1:18:24] <pigbart91> jacking off when hungover is essential. It goes jack off, mcmuffin, gatorade, coffee
[1:18:28] <bloviated> yeah but they're good for you
[1:18:31] <mrspree15> @anuscolon Awful
[1:18:31] <considerthetetrapod> i hate this
[1:18:31] <one_bad_hamburger> when it gets stuck in your nose its awful
[1:18:32] <TaintEnthusiast> puking alcohol is a waste of money too
[1:18:35] <GFunkDeluxe> I’d be happy never having to pop a zit because it would remove my ten years of acne life
[1:18:36] <mister_snipes_> lol
[1:18:36] <europeansheep> if you drank a sweet alcohol its the worst
[1:18:37] <Down10_> This is an all-time stream
[1:18:39] <dmchandler> i made a nice chicknen dinner for this stream
[1:18:39] <LilacWhimski> you feel so much better after puking alcohol
[1:18:40] <bjork_liker> I'm going to smoke a bowl, is that worse than puking?
[1:18:40] <h_dub_v_lit> Alcohol puke is the worst!

[1:19:51] <serpentine666> probably the worst thing i could imagine
[1:19:56] <rodzirvin> Demerol that ends up making you drool >>>>
[1:20:02] <umjammer_danny> last time I puked it was mcnuggets and a snickers
[1:20:04] <h_dub_v_lit> If you are puking from alcohol though, drink warm tea. It helps a lot, and isn't that bad to throw up
[1:20:06] <bloviated> I love dry heaving spitum and bile
[1:20:06] <JoeBushDotNet> I had adderall today and I put together a spreadsheet of every athlete that's ever been on the cover of a video game
[1:20:06] <Megaspel> only once?
[1:20:10] <Megaspel> I've had food poisoning so much
[1:20:13] <durkuniverse> i had food poisoning in college and had a stall in my dorm reserved for me
[1:20:16] <chippybus> Had food poisoning once and had to work an 18 hour day
[1:20:16] <Life_Alert_Salesman> When I was a kid I puked up hash browns & I couldn't eat them until I was almost 20
[1:20:18] <ARealLifeBear> I had a kidney stone a few years back and puking was the only thing that made it feel better until I got meds
[1:20:18] <GolfWatcher99> i have a really weak stomach and i get food poisoning like 1-2 times a year
[1:20:18] <coolermaster88> i got food poisoning in scottsdale on a work trip and missed 2 flights home
[1:20:19] <one_bad_hamburger> I ALWAYS puke after dollar dog night at the phillies game
[1:20:20] <buttson> you puke and feel horrible until you get something to soak up the stomach bile
[1:20:20] <tuffghost> food poisoning puking is not good
[1:20:21] <chippybus> couldn't eat or drink anything all day
[1:20:24] <puzzlemustard> #TeamPukingHelps
[1:20:25] <Dealeylama> I got food poisoning from a Wendys then gladly ate there the very next day
[1:20:26] <lil_pookie_c> what did you eat that made you get food poisoning?
[1:20:26] <BloodWorms> puking is the main problem with food poisoning
[1:20:27] <umjammer_danny> got food poisoning twice from chipotle
[1:20:27] <dumbguy_69> it hurts
[1:20:27] <eboe> 1 cum 2 pee 3 poo 4 puke and cumming is miles ahead its absurd
[1:20:28] <PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Relapse by Big Giant Circles -> https://prtzl.to/LxHp1LB1H5
[1:20:31] <SamTheNannerMan> robs puke take is explained by his lack of food poisoning
[1:20:35] <zany_antics> yeah the existence of dry heaving is enough to render this an insane take
[1:20:36] <GolfWatcher99> it is THE WORST. i can not tell you how bad it is. To say puking is somehow good is patently insane.
[1:20:37] <anuscolon> you ever had horrible nuts?
[1:20:37] <serpentine666> jf is lowkey on a roll right now

[1:20:42] <dmchandler> i've had food poisoning twice, and i caught what was maybe cholera in Morocco but it was Malaria-esque symptoms
[1:20:42] <tompeppre> just wrong
[1:20:43] <MikeASchneider> have you had a nut as bad as your worst puke
[1:20:43] <Down10_> someone register Horrible_Pukes
[1:20:45] <BBJoey> i cannot believe this shit
[1:20:45] <agarv7> insane hill to die on
[1:20:46] <lordramby> The only legit food poisoning I've ever had was after I ate two granola bars that were months expired, and then my roommate's girlfriend told me to drink vodka to kill whatever was in my stomach
[1:20:46] <Sogetastic> puking when there's nothing there is the worst
[1:20:48] <johntherun06> Does dry heaving actually count as puking though
[1:20:50] <AfroGunsou> horrible pukes? they're called the go off kings
[1:20:50] <chrome_chomsky> this is shitting and puking until your entire insides are empty, all in pain
[1:20:51] <sputnik111> ya well if stefan had a sex addiction he wouldn't be defending cumming
[1:20:51] <Megaspel> rob has never been pegged and it shows
[1:20:59] <mediumlizard> the idea that you'd rather barf instead of cum is bonkers
[1:21:00] <one_bad_hamburger> like jay buhner
[1:21:01] <jonlovesart> Used to get pretty regular migraines, and I remember appreciating puking during that time because I couldn't focus so hard on my headache. :/
[1:21:02] <McCainFlightSchool> can we please get rob some head
[1:21:02] <rushlimbaughstumors> the best puke is the hangover puke, pure relief

[1:29:53] <CarltonBanksEsq> rake I think @patbicks
[1:29:56] <George_Weed_Bush> son!

[1:30:16] <PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Make You by Sander W. -> https://prtzl.to/WBHJ1xEPFy
[1:30:19] <jazzisking> knoxville is the bread of this one
[1:30:20] <GFunkDeluxe> Bam on Cumtown was one of the most depressing things I’ve heard. Shell of a human
[1:30:22] <jazzisking> pontius is potatoes
[1:30:25] <Dealeylama> 1G2G: Macgruber, Walkhard, Popstar, Stepbrothers
[1:30:26] <howintensive> dave england did HUMAN TRICYCLE

[1:30:36] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:30:37] <patbicks> I'm a Manny Puig man himself
[1:30:39] <howintensive> AND EXTREME SQUARED
[1:30:40] <durkuniverse> hahahah
[1:30:42] <snackbandit420> pontius rules
[1:30:44] <rushlimbaughstumors> didnt Steve-o snort the wasabi?
[1:30:50] <Cornetto_32> that was a great segment stefan
[1:30:56] <5eggdinner> when he shit his pants in the van and the cameraman puked
[1:31:00] <durkuniverse> discord maybe
[1:31:01] <dr_kisses> it's separate but the cribs episode of pontius living out of his truck
[1:31:02] <TaintEnthusiast> Knoxville is like Captain America, I guess: not technically an original member, but defined them and carried them to greatness
[1:31:05] <khajimak> jackass 3 is on watchparty
[1:31:11] <khajimak> thru prime
[1:31:11] <Cornetto_32> Dave England also shit in the appliance store

[1:31:14] <mister_snipes_> just pure fear
[1:31:17] <completebreakfast> you could do a commentary track together
[1:31:17] <Faralay> You could've watched it with your PODCAST DISCORD, Stefan
[1:31:18] <FatCardinals> anybody say no-hitter yet?
[1:31:19] <rodzirvin> Making a secondary channel just to show that shit and have people sub and submit bits to this one
[1:31:25] <WheezTheSnus> toilet penis jackass zoom stream
[1:31:35] <GFunkDeluxe> Knoxville keeps it all together. The only one who can remotely “present” the show
[1:31:36] <tompeppre> is wee man in this or is it just a given that we'd get rid of wee man
[1:31:38] <durkuniverse> like all the mtv dvds they dubbed over the music
[1:31:38] <TaintEnthusiast> which edition do you have rob?
[1:31:47] <tuffghost> most of those mtv shows are fucked up like that
[1:31:51] <bakkooonn> the state dvd's are real bad
[1:31:52] <Dealeylama> Beavis and Butthead

[1:32:11] <chrome_chomsky> perfect game territory
[1:32:11] <bloviated> remember when wee man stood in front of an enormous powerful fan and then opened a parachute
[1:32:16] <mmmmspaghetti> if you watch dawsons creek streaming they have the international opening theme instead and it sucks
[1:32:21] <coach_mike_dan_tony> JF start talking about the no hitter, it'll jinx him
[1:32:24] <tompeppre> lol @bloviated
[1:32:24] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:32:33] <ghoulsnightout_> @gooffkings someone put like 14 hours of the Jackass 24 hour MTV takeover on archive and I was gonna stream it all yesterday but I’m lazy
[1:32:34] <brgrho> @Nightbot Very sorry. Had no idea we couldn't talk about the sponsor.
[1:32:37] <GhoulSzn22> make sure not to talk about the no hitter...oops
