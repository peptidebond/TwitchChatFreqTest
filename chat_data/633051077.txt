[0:15:24] <Kelbaenor> Chris is right
[0:15:24] <hectordoink> nugs in the stove after are still good

[0:15:27] <coldslaw69> I'm still eating big macs from BEFORE quarantine
[0:15:27] <acoolguyishere> i microwave the whole burger

[0:15:36] <Timb0nic> it only costs $3 you don't need to save it
[0:15:36] <WheezTheSnus> toaster oven mcnuggets are good

[0:25:43] <pecotaredux> subway meatball subs are okay
[0:25:44] <usernamehaver> it's good, especially with the arby's sauce and horseradish sauce
[0:25:44] <Eroq12> subway is sad
[0:25:45] <ARealLifeBear> I'll fuck up an Italian BMT
[0:25:46] <djork> well, better than taco bell

[0:30:01] <estcejai> CULVERS BUTTER BURGER
[0:30:01] <big__soda> from my home state
[0:30:02] <burls> Culvers is phenomenal
[0:30:02] <BasementHippo> it whips
[0:30:03] <jazzisking> nasty processed butter shit all over everything
[0:30:03] <donromney> they got frozen yog too
[0:30:03] <markovblanket> get the cheese curds
[0:30:03] <theoriginalferg> Culvers slaps
[0:30:05] <DaneKnight> good ice cream
[0:30:05] <artdamage> culvers has decent fish and chips
[0:30:05] <pecotaredux> They make butterburgers
[0:30:06] <SoundAlerts> durkuniverse played Moby Noise for 200 Bits

[0:30:10] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> Culvers is so good
[0:30:10] <stanmeyer44> Culver’s fries are a little suspect though
[0:30:11] <sawks> in n out
[0:30:12] <walter_brando> Culver’s is a better Braums
[0:30:12] <LilacWhimski> there are some culvers in texas but I've never been to one
[0:30:13] <stuntman_chip> Steak fries are inconsistent
[0:30:16] <copsareharam> I guess in-n-out
[0:30:17] <chillBuu> not fast food but waffle house
[0:30:18] <therudebeast> weird, i clicked on the go off kings twitch stream link, but i ended up on some doughboys VOD thing, and wiger looks AWFUL down there in the bottom left
[0:30:18] <trigross> their cheese curds suck ass tbh tho
[0:30:20] <Timb0nic> Crinkle cut are very low tier of fry types
[0:30:20] <awokes> for me its waffle house

[0:30:24] <HowdyItsJR> whataburger
[0:30:25] <spookytapes> whataburger kicks ass
[0:30:27] <majorleagueyahtzee> Culver's food is great but all the tweens hang out there all the time and stand right in front of the soda machine
[0:30:27] <riiickyrubio> whataburger whips ass

[0:30:30] <DJ_Dylan27> Culver's butter burger is the bomb
[0:30:30] <bronsonosaurus_rex> if you've never had bojangles you're missing out
[0:30:31] <hectordoink> King of Donair for a Canadian one
[0:30:31] <big__soda> you don't get fries at culvers, you get rings or curds
[0:30:31] <joeveralls> whataburger sucks ass
[0:30:31] <pecotaredux> waterburger, as full nelson says
[0:30:32] <cccrys> green Chile double
[0:30:32] <kremdog28> Why would you get Culver’s fries when you could get the curds though
[0:30:33] <LilacWhimski> whataburger has such good breakfast
[0:30:33] <sawks> cookout fucking rules
[0:30:34] <Land_Phil> whatabuger fucking rocks

[0:30:36] <HowdyItsJR> it's so good
[0:30:38] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> Culver's fries are ehhh though, gotta get chili cheese fries or no fries at all
[0:30:38] <BasementHippo> I've never had White Castle besides the frozen packs
[0:30:40] <shanept82> whataburger is overrated
[0:30:42] <migrainethresher> i just ate dinner and now i want a burg!
[0:30:42] <markovblanket> I'm from NC. Cookout whips ass
[0:30:44] <stuntman_chip> Butter burgers
[0:30:45] <stanmeyer44> Underrated is that Culver’s has weird shit like pot roast
[0:30:47] <gegen_press> whataburger dine-in is so fun

[0:30:57] <walter_brando> Cookout does whip ass
[0:30:58] <pecotaredux> fries at culver's is a losing pick, curds 100%
[0:30:58] <LilacWhimski> jalapenos are a must on whataburger
[0:30:58] <Land_Phil> i love cookout
[0:30:59] <listenerdave> https://www.eatthis.com/most-caloric-dishes-in-america/

[0:31:02] <DaneKnight> i reported that poll
[0:31:02] <eyeonicDJ> Culvers also has chili cheese fries and at some point had pretzel bites
[0:31:03] <headlesspresident> swiss chalet
[0:31:03] <LRonFrancis> both worth it
[0:31:04] <copsareharam> culver's curds aren't even the best curds you can get, no wisconsin bar you'll ever go to breads their curds

[0:36:48] <puzzlemustard> chris could just go to good restaurants
[0:36:49] <LilStinker> take your fork and knife and cut the burger down the middle. Take each half and set it down on the plate flat side down
[0:36:49] <faartdvark> the best burger in manhattan is at brindle room

[0:37:28] <chillBuu> chris is allowed near an open flame??
[0:37:29] <farthammer1> Canada has like 5 restaurants and they are all A&W
[0:37:30] <BasementHippo> this dumb dumb trying to tell me Au Cheval only has tall burgers
[0:37:30] <NHLPlayerToreyKrug> how fancy?
[0:37:34] <craoulence> also the burger is usually way cheaper than other things, so if you get dragged to a place it can be a good copout

[0:37:38] <panicwearehanginghere> What's a fancy restaurant?
[0:37:40] <LilStinker> I ended a friendship after my buddy made us go to a burger restaurant whos cheapest burger was $25 and cheapest beer was $11
[0:37:42] <Dealeylama> Mortons
[0:37:42] <ap_t> Chris what about when you're really broke but people insist you go to that fancy place and you dont want to spend on like a steak
[0:37:44] <Down10_> Praise al a carte
[0:37:46] <estcejai> i think 20 bucks is the most i'd pay for a burger
[0:37:46] <JoeBushDotNet> went to a burger place in Salina KS that had burgers with peanut butter on it
[0:37:47] <lil_pookie_c> brioche buns
[0:37:47] <jazzisking> gotta narrow it down brother
[0:37:47] <JadedWombat> describe fancy
[0:37:47] <BasementHippo> how about a fancy restaurant that is specifically a fancy burger restaurant?
[0:37:48] <Source_Force> Kuma's is good, but not the best
[0:37:48] <Land_Phil> @joeveralls no i lived there for about 2 years for grad school
[0:37:49] <bjork_liker> Please respect me, Chris
[0:37:50] <headlesspresident> yeah what is fancy

[0:37:50] <europeansheep> 100 each or for 2?
[0:37:51] <considerthetetrapod> what the fuck
[0:37:51] <LaOwlLOL> Chris we don't have those in the U.S. unless you are amillionair.
[0:37:52] <panicwearehanginghere> Cause like I think a fancy restuarant I don't think they have burgers
[0:37:53] <braddawson> thats not fancy so a burger is fine
[0:37:53] <LannyMcDonald> McCormick Steak Seasoning in the home burger
[0:37:53] <WolfofWallmarket> What are you talking about Chris?
[0:37:53] <LilacWhimski> the burger at those places is frequently by far the cheapest thing to eat
[0:37:54] <listenerdave> have any of you ever done a "eat this burrito/whatever and win a prize"?
[0:37:55] <Down10_> huh?
[0:37:56] <jonhendren> fancy restaurant = you change your clothes to go there
[0:37:57] <Chexoid> I will order chicken fingers and fries with chocolate milk, thats wassup baby
[0:37:57] <ShooterMart> $100 for a hamburger would be fucked
[0:37:58] <winzigwinsbig> @ap_t has the right idea
[0:37:59] <jazzisking> brioche buns are bullshit
[0:37:59] <boogercousins> Classist Chris
[0:38:00] <pecotaredux> @Source_Force the lockdown used to be my favorite chicago burger
[0:38:01] <farthammer1> I have spent $20 on a burger instead of a $40 steak and I was happy with my choice
[0:38:02] <Timb0nic> Chris they don't even have burgers at those restaurants and if they do they are probably made with insane ingredients
[0:38:03] <0mnivore> I have never been to a fancy restaurant
[0:38:03] <springbreakmyheart> dont think ive ever gone to a $100 restaurant
[0:38:04] <alpacinogruntingnoise> remember when Steve Martin said hamburger in Pink Panther. I thought that was hilarious.
[0:38:07] <sharkbutt> a 14 dollar hamburger is really good, gotta disagree Chris
[0:38:08] <swearholes> I'd easy pay 30 for a burger than 60 for a steak
[0:38:09] <Down10_> I want a burger now
[0:38:11] <WolfofWallmarket> Burger CAN be better than steak
[0:38:12] <TaintEnthusiast> those kind of steakhouses suck shit, they aren't actual good restaurants they're just expensive
[0:38:14] <mmmmspaghetti> chris or stefan had you guys ever had skyline or any other Cincinnati chili?

[0:38:58] <dunkaccino> its bad
[0:38:58] <Source_Force> @pecotaredux I meant to go, but never did. It's the same chef as Kuma's right?
[0:38:59] <dgbnr> it sucks ass
[0:39:00] <tinybaby> it is poop
[0:39:00] <markovblanket> it's good with the raw onions
[0:39:01] <sawks> is it better than the bag chili
[0:39:02] <pecotaredux> crawfish is trash seafood, terrible food to effort ratio required
[0:39:04] <spookytapes> drizzling shits on a plate of spaghetti
[0:39:06] <FatCardinals> cincinnati chili is vile
[0:39:06] <Land_Phil> crawfish is delicious this chat sucks tonight!
[0:39:07] <jonhendren> skyline chili is a poop food
[0:39:08] <copsareharam> the macedonians may have cursed cincy with that chili
[0:39:09] <dmlat> i personally prefer crawfish to oysters but oysters are so unique that you can't get rid of them

[0:39:11] <leedo_> i used to live across the street from a skyline

[0:39:14] <leedo_> learned to love it
[0:39:14] <mmmmspaghetti> rob that is the first time i've ever heard anyone have a neutral take on skyline chili
[0:39:15] <bloviated> ecological concerns prevent me from picking oysters
[0:39:16] <BasementHippo> Chris sometimes lower class people see the menu at a fancy restaurant and get overwhelmed, can't understand the fancy words, and just want a burger. Don't shame them
[0:39:16] <gillycintheplace2b> There’s this one fancy restaurant makes my favorite burger ever I miss going there
[0:39:16] <gegen_press> Skyline is fun
[0:39:17] <SocialistWaluigi> speaking of regional food, any of you guys ever had garbage plates?
[0:39:20] <therudebeast> it's a good atmosphere (at least one slug can be found there)
[0:39:21] <105iq> its nasty wet spaghetti with wet meat and orange shredded cheddar. its really good

[0:39:30] <winzigwinsbig> never had crawfish or oysters
[0:39:32] <pecotaredux> @Source_Force I think so, definitely a similar decor. A show at the empty bottle and a lockdown warden, ooh wee
[0:39:33] <turpin4prez> st louis and chicago style pizzas are both good

[0:39:48] <joeveralls> yeah in kentucky
[0:39:49] <faartdvark> frozen skyline chili, jesus christ
[0:39:50] <BasementHippo> both Chicago styles of pizza are the best
[0:39:55] <sharkbutt> frozen skyline chili is a fucking dire thought
[0:39:55] <joeveralls> the cinci airport is in kentuck
[0:39:56] <105iq> theres a skyline in northeast ohio and it fucking sucks for some reason
[0:40:00] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> Steak n' Shake does chili macs and they're good as hell tbh
[0:40:02] <dgbnr> cincinnatti chili is made from dog vomit they said it on the news
[0:40:03] <migrainethresher> @GoOffKings Wienerschnitzel?
[0:40:07] <estcejai> you gotta give it up for the chicago style hot dog. a truly tremendous dog
[0:40:10] <hmdiv> Corner Bistro

[1:40:36] <sputnik111> a true professional
[1:40:38] <sharkbutt> i'm here to pull hard
[1:40:42] <burls> id rather get blown out
[1:40:46] <JoeBushDotNet> I would rather win the game
[1:40:55] <BasementHippo> stefan is right
[1:40:56] <jffranco> get destroyed is way better
[1:41:06] <BasementHippo> I would rather have not seen any of it if it's a close loss
[1:41:13] <farthammer1> I am an A's fan and the 2001 playoffs hurts more than anything.Gimme a blow-out.
[1:41:16] <jffranco> no entertainment in in a loss.
[1:41:18] <LilacWhimski> they both suck ass
[1:41:25] <sharkbutt> as a niners fan heartbreaking loss is more of a gut punch
[1:41:27] <BasementHippo> Northwestern Football fan I have experience, blowouts are way better
[1:41:27] <Sogetastic> The 7-1 Germany Brazil game I've ever seen
[1:41:32] <Timb0nic> @GoOffKings Stefan what do you think about the NHL plan???
[1:41:34] <fartmcdoodooass> the dodgers losing to the astros sucked so fucking bad
[1:41:36] <zany_antics> disagree
[1:41:37] <vanapps> @farthammer1 same
[1:41:40] <AfroGunsou> great poll
[1:41:42] <BasementHippo> so much better when you can check out of the entire 2nd half
[1:41:50] <ChrisKyleMacLachlan> Stefan is a baby brain Vancouver fan
[1:41:51] <johntherun06> Stefan at least you got blown out in game 7
[1:41:52] <serpentine666> loser mentality!!
[1:41:56] <egregiousfuqup> if you gotta lose, get it done fast
[1:41:57] <serpentine666> stefan is wrong!
[1:41:59] <Land_Phil> i agree with stefan
[1:42:01] <tacobellass> i'm a saints fan and stefan is 100% correct
[1:42:01] <turpin4prez> stefan remember when the blues beat the canucks in OT this year on a 3 on 0 breakaway
[1:42:02] <bjork_liker> You just win it all the next year like the KC Royals
[1:42:02] <Land_Phil> im a bills and a sabres fan
[1:42:04] <ClassicMach> as a lightning fan i have seen a heartbreaking loss in a final and a humiliating first round sweep just a few years apart and i really preferred getting swept by cbj
[1:42:04] <prezofstefannation> stefan is awesome
[1:42:05] <BroPair> remember the stream from stefan's den during the nhl draft
[1:42:06] <Land_Phil> and i like the mets
[1:42:30] <farthammer1> What playoffs?
[1:42:36] <BroPair> I have quit football basically

[1:42:39] <CovfefeDobson> the Canucks are finally fun again though
[1:42:42] <sputnik111> I woulda been wrecked if the Raptors lost last year after that run
[1:42:43] <coolermaster88> stefan i was behind michael leighton in 2010 when patrick kane scored that goal in game 6 of the final and you can actually see my soul leave my body
[1:42:45] <bjork_liker> Oh hey! The Mets are who KC beat!
[1:42:46] <cosmocat69> Sabre’s aren’t in the playoffs so it’s not legitimate
[1:42:47] <prezofstefannation> stefan looks like a hot teen
[1:42:47] <Deadlydog> old man chris

[1:43:09] <prezofstefannation> stefan is a hunk
[1:43:12] <farthammer1> I am almost 40
[1:43:16] <Deadlydog> That just means your the most experienced at life
[1:43:16] <mmmmspaghetti> @ClassicMach it helps that the jackets sweep was literally the high point so far for the franchise
[1:43:19] <egregiousfuqup> you are hanging these curves JF
[1:43:22] <bjork_liker> I'm 37

[1:43:26] <xlcurd> YES
[1:43:34] <Land_Phil> i've seen two world series losses including the piazza/clemens bat throw and a dumb terry collins decision to leave harvey, brett hull half crease incident, and 4 straight super bowl losses.
[1:43:34] <CarltonBanksEsq> come be a sharks fan, stefan. it is pain
[1:43:39] <Kelbaenor> Good move stefan
[1:43:43] <rodzirvin> Didnt hockey just change to a new playoff format today? @GoOffKings
[1:43:44] <ClassicMach> @mmmmspaghetti thats probably a big part of it. had it been detroit or new york it would have been much worse.
[1:43:47] <prezofstefannation> stefan rocks
[1:43:47] <zany_antics> stefan you should become a coyotes fan. it's bad but you get some built in ironic distance. because it's the fucking coyotes

[1:44:00] <farthammer1> The A's owner just furloughed a ton of employees and I am ready to quit baseball
[1:44:01] <xlcurd> high heat messes everyone up

[1:44:12] <kolbotn> absolute scum
[1:44:17] <JoeBushDotNet> Worst owners in a league with Joey Saputo and Stan Kroenke
[1:44:18] <prezofstefannation> chris! please stop talking over stefan
[1:44:18] <Land_Phil> at least terry palgulea actually wants his teams to win he just made his money in fracking
[1:44:19] <Timb0nic> He almost had a really sick goal today
[1:44:20] <fartmcdoodooass> if like one player gets covid they'll have to cancel it lmao
[1:44:37] <farthammer1> John Fisher is worth 2 Billion and is not paying employees the equivalent of like a million a year

[1:50:52] <cosmocat69> We need Jerry to hold everyone together
[1:50:53] <skungus> jerry is the least funny character
[1:50:56] <serpentine666> this is a pro-Michael Richards stream
[1:50:56] <Land_Phil> danger20Wow danger20Wow danger20Wow
[1:50:56] <BasementHippo> you can't just get rid of the straight man
[1:50:59] <johntherun06> Jerry also dated a fuckin 17 year old didn’t he?
[1:51:00] <BroPair> who tf is voting for kramer
[1:51:00] <archurrooo> jerry gotta go... pickup his high school girlfriend
[1:51:00] <skungus> also a bad person irl
[1:51:01] <panicwearehanginghere> Kramer did his racist shit but Jerry dated an underage girl
[1:51:02] <mmmmspaghetti> jerry is the equalizer
[1:51:02] <GhoulSzn22> 1) george 2) elaine 3) kramer 4) jerry
[1:51:04] <bloviated> Kramer and Elaine spinoff would work
[1:51:07] <xlcurd> one on
[1:51:07] <alpacinogruntingnoise> No way, Julia Louis-Dreyfus the best
[1:51:08] <copsareharam> yeah
[1:51:09] <ApollOrc> having it be called seinfeld without jerry being in it would be a great joke
[1:51:10] <fartmcdoodooass> hes just the straight man
[1:51:11] <mmmmspaghetti> but he still gotta go
[1:51:13] <LilacWhimski> elaine rules
[1:51:15] <TaintEnthusiast> the person that voted for george should know I'm coming for them
[1:51:21] <Timb0nic> George #1
[1:51:24] <xlcurd> good eye
[1:51:24] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> chuck seinfeld replace him with newman
[1:51:24] <BasementHippo> actually, good point, Curb shows us that you don't really need a straight man
[1:51:26] <serpentine666> you honestly cant get rid of any of them
[1:51:27] <alpacinogruntingnoise> George was my favorite as a kid but Elaine is god tier funny
[1:51:28] <lord_googoo> George > Elaine > Kramer >>>>>>>> Jerry
[1:51:28] <fartmcdoodooass> the physical comedy
[1:51:29] <MarsIsWaiting> you guys hear what he said at the stand up club
[1:51:30] <cosmocat69> The great thing about George, Elaine and Kramer is they aren’t friends individually. They’re only friends through Jerry. It’s what makes the whole thing work.
[1:51:32] <naffologist> i don't think george, elaine, or kramer would hang out without jerry though
[1:51:32] <pecotaredux> make george elaine's brother, keep kramer as the neighbor, boom
[1:51:34] <prezofstefannation> Sheldon is funnier than Kramer
[1:51:35] <Nightbot> Hey, if you've got Amazon Prime, you can link it up to your Twitch account and get a free stream subscription! Which you can then use on this stream! Pretty neat!
[1:51:35] <LilacWhimski> get rid of jerry
[1:51:38] <BlueFrogJam> good eye jf
[1:51:38] <xlcurd> incredible
[1:51:38] <BroPair> 7 people voted for kramer
[1:51:39] <skungus> george and elaine tied for #1
[1:51:40] <BroPair> insane
[1:51:42] <Sogetastic> Kramer is better the further he is removed from the A plot
[1:51:46] <ApollOrc> who voted for george
[1:51:46] <pecotaredux> @prezofstefannation come on now
[1:51:46] <cosmocat69> If they were all friends on their own it would be Friends
[1:51:51] <BasementHippo> JLD rocks
[1:51:54] <rodzirvin> Chris' favorite Kramer moment happened at the comedy story
[1:51:57] <theoriginalferg> rob jerked it to elaine
[1:51:58] <alpacinogruntingnoise> Actually my favorite Seinfeld actor is Al Pacino
[1:52:00] <mmmmspaghetti> elaine doesn't like george and they would not hang out, it's pretty well established in the show
[1:52:01] <rodzirvin> store* fuck
[1:52:02] <LaOwlLOL> is jerry on the flight logs?
[1:52:02] <gor_gol> The episode where Elaine is George and George is Elaine is the best one
[1:52:03] <kolbotn> chris is Sancho going to UTD or what?
[1:52:06] <JoeBushDotNet> When it comes to bowling, I love A Lane!
