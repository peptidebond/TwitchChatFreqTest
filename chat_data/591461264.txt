[0:41:43] <DrOrpheusMD> medieval europe was very muddy
[0:41:44] <YoS0ySauce> Dragons flew around everywhere.
[0:41:45] <howintensive> Websters defines medieval as
[0:41:48] <tescovaluegin> peedieval poorupe
[0:41:48] <bluestraveler666> Medeival europe was not a land of contrasts, and in fact was very straightforward.
[0:41:50] <umjammer_danny> medievil wasn't just a ps1 game
[0:41:52] <McCainFlightSchool> webster's dictionary defines medieval europe as
[0:41:53] <arcademattchristman> the m4trix 4, brought you by m4sterc4rd
[0:41:54] <WealthyWalrus> People died of the plague but some didn't
[0:41:54] <buttson> in medievial europe humans evolved to have two assess
[0:41:54] <zany_antics> @peteypabloooo "the truly fascinating thing is, every peasant had a very large pair of breasts."
[0:41:55] <andyateacrayon> In this paper pee pee poo poo
[0:41:55] <shampoodler> People lucky enough to have windows in medieval Europe threw their shit out of them
[0:41:56] <JoeBushDotNet> Charlemagne was tall as shit
[0:41:57] <lipwipwipwip> Some of it was medigood
[0:41:57] <ChuddTruckley> medigood
[0:41:58] <scubadoo2188> All the people smelled like shit.
[0:41:58] <tjborg> lol
[0:41:59] <hectordoink> low good was better than midevil
[0:41:59] <birdmoths> JF had a better thesis statement than Stefan
[0:42:03] <heycorvidae> the battle of grunvald kicked ass
[0:42:04] <dadm1lk> it was the medieval times, it was the worst of times it was the blurst of times
[0:42:04] <oofty_goofty_> It smelled like pee pee and poo poo all the time.
[0:42:05] <0mnivore> It was kinda Midnice
[0:42:05] <TheGreatCactusJac> Medieval Europe was full of smelly people who do not wipe their ass, it was truly a horrible time to be alive.
[0:42:06] <tangelllo> Cucked men would be paraded around town on riding backwards on a horse
[0:42:11] <GhoulSzn22> It was bad to be a serf in the Middle Ages imo
[0:42:12] <xannyboy420> sounded real cool
[0:42:16] <celerymannnn> Also, the Blue knight NEVER FUCKING WON cuz it's rigged as SHIT
[0:42:16] <wanderingass> a hand for wiping
[0:42:17] <howintensive> Websters defines "Europe" as...
[0:42:18] <gegen_press> Medieval Europe was split into two classes, Knights and Princesses.
[0:42:19] <freedeweezy> im gonna get medieval in your ass
[0:42:20] <big__soda> what if medieval europe sounded like jay leno? i think it would go something like this...
[0:42:20] <migrainethresher> @peteypabloooo The eras before are considered "more eval" while the eras after are "less eval"
[0:42:22] <wanderingass> a hand for eating
[0:42:23] <CFOBedung> Medieval Europe was colloquially known as "The Land of Mids"
[0:42:24] <peteypabloooo> @gooffkings I will not be figuring that part out.
[0:42:26] <rodzirvin> In medieval times, they use to die at 25 cause of doodoo in their ass
[0:42:30] <friggindummy> didn't they remake it?
[0:42:31] <M_Go_Dead> they had a new one
[0:42:32] <Smallkittensonfire> what i learned from ap history: don't fill out the flash cards because the teacher will forget to ask for them

[0:42:36] <naffologist> tyler perry's medieval
[0:42:37] <M_Go_Dead> wasn't as good
[0:42:38] <therudebeast> medieval europe was primarily influenced by two warring familes, the starks and the thrones
[0:42:42] <arcademattchristman> !matrix
[0:42:43] <chrome_chomsky> in medieval times you get a free crown at the end of your meal
[0:42:43] <Down10_> You might think by the name "Medieval Europe" that it was bad—even, perhaps, evil. But it was mostly quite good!"

[0:43:10] <noodledealerpro> The court of Burgundy was fucked dude. That shit was crazy.
[0:43:11] <friggindummy> i thought beatles was the correct way to spell the insect
[0:43:11] <C00LlN> While we consider it long ago and far removed from the present day, the era was pregnant with many changes that created the world we know today

[0:48:12] <sharkbutt> i have mixed feelings
[0:48:14] <mikelenehan> he shows up from time to time
[0:48:16] <SneezySleazy> He's an anti-cockshaft
[0:48:17] <ApollOrc> he's a dumb ass
[0:48:18] <munt69> can't stand him
[0:48:18] <arcademattchristman> I dont get bill burr
[0:48:19] <alteredbeef> Love bill burr
[0:48:20] <Down10_> Yeah, I thought Bill Burr was the smart guy
[0:48:20] <WealthyWalrus> hate him
[0:48:22] <usernamehaver> not a fan
[0:48:23] <bussanut_> never been a fan
[0:48:23] <its_doggety> people who like bill burr like him because "he just makes sense!"
[0:48:24] <chilyourselfevery1aroundu> He had his time
[0:48:24] <bloviated> just a dumb Boston guy idk
[0:48:30] <therudebeast> bill burr certainly knows how to tell a joke
[0:48:31] <andyateacrayon> JF can you say "genre" like Alex Trebek please?
[0:48:31] <bobricebobrice> i went to a bill burr show at the wilbur in boston, but i don
[0:48:32] <zany_antics> don't really care about burr but I like jeselnik
[0:48:33] <eyeonicDJ> angry comics arent funny to me anymore
[0:48:33] <pariah_doggy> I like Bill Burr. Hate Dipaolo.
[0:48:33] <theorbitoclast> not after nanette
[0:48:37] <friggindummy> his early standups were great
[0:48:38] <rodzirvin> I went to his show at TD Garden in Boston. He was funny, his fans are AWFUL
[0:48:38] <Max_Hanson> i also used to like him now i dont care
[0:48:47] <farthammer1> For my money the only comedy I need is right here with you all.
[0:48:47] <bluestraveler666> i agree, snl is really funny
[0:48:48] <alteredbeef> He’d go on the shock jock shows and call out their racist bullshit
[0:48:50] <peteypabloooo> He just gets mad about women and shit which appeals to like 60% of dudes
[0:48:52] <Down10_> I haven't listened to Burr's podcast in years
[0:48:55] <therudebeast> @farthammer1 lol
[0:48:57] <Its_Endless_Mike> burr is a transohpobe but he also chewed anthony cumia out on air for being a huge racist
[0:48:57] <dmchandler> I thought burr was a real good standup, but is annoying when he's treated as if he's making statements
[0:48:58] <gravitaswhatgravitas> Bill Burr Baggins
[0:49:00] <bloviated> his podcast was one of the first I listened to
[0:49:00] <Loocem> his first specials went from being about 75 percent funny to about 25 percent funny, imo
[0:49:04] <Nwhamer> all standup is trash
[0:49:09] <eyeonicDJ> bill burr is unoriginal and outdated
[0:49:09] <arcademattchristman> @gravitaswhatgravitas thats good
[0:49:10] <tescovaluegin> truly cannot imagine sitting and watching a standup special in 2020
[0:49:15] <Down10_> here's a mirror
[0:49:16] <durkuniverse> he sounds like every boston bar
[0:49:17] <porchcrop> bill go brrrrr

[1:24:32] <kaceysub> it's photoelectric
[1:24:36] <Killertableleg> I just made a copycat of the Benihana ginger sauce and taht shit slaps
[1:24:39] <therudebeast> https://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+do+smoke+detectors+work
[1:24:40] <Timb0nic> lol
[1:24:41] <tjborg> smoke alarmist
[1:24:42] <icecold_beer> photovoltaic is solar panels
[1:24:42] <lipwipwipwip> this game mode is voltaic
[1:24:47] <evilcheeba> What the hell is the score, the layout is covering the score.
[1:24:47] <springbreakmyheart> stefan is RE-volting
[1:24:50] <gegen_press> its electric
[1:24:51] <CovfefeDobson> steam can set them off though
[1:24:51] <sharkbutt> it's cool that i can't tell what teams are what
[1:24:52] <tennekey_> photovoltaic is triggered by light scattering because of the smoke
[1:24:55] <Ohboymb> guy drops the word "photovoltaic" to correct his friend and gets pissed off at the comments
[1:24:55] <gegen_press> boogie woogie woogie
[1:24:56] <eboe> photovoltaic is when you take a picture of a volcano
[1:24:57] <farthammer1> Icecold_beer is right. I was a smoke alarm engineer for 27 years.
[1:24:58] <drippedout> it's pronounced lis smith
[1:24:59] <toilet_noise> photovoltaic is when someone takes a photo of JF playing FIFA Volta
[1:24:59] <tennekey_> not because it can see a flame
[1:25:12] <tjborg> boo volta booo
[1:25:13] <biggest_fans> The AI on beginner mode is so funny
[1:25:15] <warcranium_> dudes.. playing with chicks?.. come on
[1:25:24] <CovfefeDobson> this game mode isnt voltaic either
[1:25:30] <therudebeast> no rules - just right
[1:25:32] <eboe> nice punch up
[1:25:34] <Ohboymb> the ball is the object, and it is a sphere
[1:25:36] <swearholes> Is this supposed to be futsal
[1:25:37] <goose_chaser> its soccer but small
[1:25:38] <jeffwiiver> how is everyone handling quarantine? im actually very happy, hoping for the best for everyone who is sick or laid off
[1:25:39] <Ohboymb> : )
[1:25:40] <GhoulSzn22> futsal, yes
[1:25:43] <Timb0nic> 3 v 3 is more fun
[1:25:44] <GhoulSzn22> out of bounds and shit
[1:25:52] <Max_Hanson> ive never played this mode. seems dumb
[1:25:56] <migrainethresher> not in this country

[1:26:38] <coach_mike_dan_tony> a futsal ball also has a smaller bladder so it's heavier

[1:27:09] <meat_raffle> back walls
[1:27:14] <farthammer1> "Photovoltaics is the conversion of light into electricity using semiconducting materials that exhibit the photovoltaic effect, a phenomenon studied in physics, photochemistry, and electrochemistry. Examples of this are solar panels and Jesse's teeny weeny balls"
[1:27:23] <GhoulSzn22> and tiny goals
[1:27:24] <serpentine666> lol
[1:27:24] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:27:28] <tubapuddingjr> lol
[1:27:30] <KaiSquared> yeah but even smaller goal
[1:27:31] <chrome_chomsky> lol
[1:27:38] <therudebeast> i know everyone is in a weird place right now, but i want you to know, Photoelectric alarms work using a photoelectric sensor and a light source. As smoke enters the chamber and crosses the path of the light beam, light is scattered by the smoke particles, aiming it toward the sensor, which in turn triggers the alarm.
[1:27:39] <farthammer1> that's off the dome
[1:27:45] <freedeweezy> lol
[1:27:45] <ApollOrc> ?
[1:27:46] <hrkac> hmm which jon could that be
[1:27:48] <McCainFlightSchool> lol

[2:10:41] <dreww> kind of unfair
[2:10:54] <zany_antics> it was funny FOR a late night show

[2:11:28] <meat_raffle> limmy is great craig ferguson sucks
[2:11:28] <TaintEnthusiast> not the famously funny belgians
[2:11:30] <CurlyW> given the limitations of a talk show on US network TV, it was very good
[2:11:32] <Land_Phil> https://twitter.com/DaftLimmy/status/1249437211898138625?s=20
[2:11:34] <dmchandler> karl pilkington is funny
[2:11:35] <therudebeast> craig ferguson was ok and non-committal and kind of like john oliver in that way
[2:11:37] <Eggfriend2> you should watch "The Thick of it", thats actual good british comedy stuff
[2:11:40] <dreww> how about uh mitchell and webb or whatever
[2:11:48] <Dealeylama> He was good on drew carey show

[2:12:12] <CurlyW> Webb sucks
[2:12:14] <goatshead> i'll never get over how confidently Jesse shares his opinion on comedy despite everyone here knowing he's a family guy fan
[2:12:14] <pariah_doggy> Steve Coogan rocks
[2:12:17] <CurlyW> Mitchell I think is fine

[2:13:53] <jamberg> Lol
[2:13:54] <brock_boeser> robert webb is labour
[2:13:57] <slow_biden> Mitchell being a libdem makes so much sense
[2:14:01] <jamberg> Lamar rules
[2:14:03] <puzzlemustard> JF i think it's time to come out swinging
[2:14:04] <johntherun06> Hamlet 2 is actually really really good
[2:14:11] <friggindummy> what is super hans politics?

[2:14:18] <slow_biden> anarchist
[2:14:19] <mayoH20> id like to rub it out on jesse
[2:14:20] <Dealeylama> Hamlet 2 has the best final line in a comedy ever

[2:15:05] <slow_biden> peep show bachelor party episode is great
[2:15:12] <CurlyW> Mitchell married whats-er-face, right?
[2:15:12] <Dealeylama> You all are confusing Webb and Mitchell
[2:15:20] <CurlyW> Webb is the known terf
[2:15:30] <ChrisKyleMacLachlan> mitchell is married to the poker player

[2:38:41] <Land_Phil> here we go
[2:38:42] <farthammer1> Marriage is a land of contrasts
[2:38:48] <spazygoat> 90 day fiance is one of the most entertaining shows on tv
[2:38:49] <jamberg> Broke: late night doom streams woke: late night 90 day fiancé streams

[2:39:23] <gulpo19> visa to the US...access to a plex server...who are we to judge
[2:39:25] <farthammer1> Webster's Dictionary defines Marriage as a series of tubes
[2:39:26] <LilStinker> just another piece of media that recklessly ppromotes monogamy
[2:39:26] <goatshead> marriage is an institution of contrasts
[2:39:27] <oldnick42> Fuck the Noid.
