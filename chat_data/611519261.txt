[0:01:37] <Nightbot> I have been using Venus 2-3 times a week most often for 1-3 hours, have owned Venus2001 for little over 17 years. I have been experimenting with the Venus2000 and do not release every time I have session but I hold sperm anywhere from 2 to 3 weeks…the sexual tension increase and it feels amazing, I stay very sexual and look forward to my next session with Venus.

[2:00:16] <BloodWorms> wow, british tv sounds like it's reached the next level of really depressing content
[2:00:20] <0mnivore> Who in the world would subject themself to that?

[2:00:43] <therudebeast> and when i show my asshole on american tv, i get in legal trouble, what kind of double standard is that
[2:00:44] <twotontesticle> Truly the way apes mate
[2:00:44] <GhoulSzn22> lolol
[2:00:48] <TaintEnthusiast> british women are drawn to me, they can detect that I am their distant cousin
[2:00:51] <considerthetetrapod> my dick looks horriblle
[2:00:55] <CerberusSystem> jesse, there's a product called manscaped that may help you
[2:01:01] <Pliny_theElder> surely they spruce you up down there before the show. imagine having that job
[2:01:05] <considerthetetrapod> flaccid is not a good look
[2:01:14] <therudebeast> if anything more hair would help
[2:01:18] <EpochError> lets hear what the issues are
[2:01:20] <foygus_> just thousands of sores
[2:01:21] <sawks> growers not showers
[2:01:22] <AfroGunsou> its the toilenail thing
[2:01:26] <MyHeroZer0> i bet they take something for that before filming
[2:01:30] <coldslaw69> when do they shoe the toenail coming out of the penis
[2:01:30] <toilet_noise> jesses balls are at the wrong end of his dick
[2:01:34] <considerthetetrapod> @AfroGunsou toilenail?

[2:01:55] <AfroGunsou> @considerthetetrapod cmon
[2:01:56] <twotontesticle> I notice a real lack of focus on the nuts
[2:02:02] <uoenodoe> that sounds good
[2:02:03] <braddawson> just started torrenting two seasons of this show
[2:02:07] <goatshead> the whole time the host is slapping her pussy
[2:02:13] <markovblanket> sounds more relatable
[2:02:14] <EpochError> uhhhh
[2:02:15] <Aestro17> oh god imagine doing a naked hug without getting a boner on national tv
[2:02:19] <MarsIsWaiting> the british are fucking weird

[2:02:35] <Ohboymb> is the bbc doing a kickstarter
[2:02:36] <goatshead> fuck that racist little island
[2:02:41] <completebreakfast> jf showing off
[2:02:45] <EpochError> my favorite short lived mike bit was when he said jesse had a penis like a credit card. just completely flat
[2:02:46] <munt69> I watched a few seasons of love island and that shit was bad but this is another level
[2:02:47] <toilet_noise> embarrassing bodies is just people with gross medical things

[2:03:01] <considerthetetrapod> oh
[2:03:05] <AfroGunsou> @taintenthusiast lol
[2:03:20] <TaintEnthusiast> I saw a giraffe autopsy on uk tv, I think it might have been richard dawkins
[2:03:20] <Pliny_theElder> and still they cancelled Utopia. clowns
[2:03:21] <therudebeast> therudebeast gifted a Tier 1 sub to FaceCutter! They have given 31 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:03:21] <usernamehaver> I don't believe it
[2:03:24] <tompeppre> they love naked people over there
[2:03:25] <ruffdrafter> freaks
[2:03:28] <springbreakmyheart> shamefully missing an eye
[2:03:30] <BloodWorms> these shows sound deeply depressing
[2:03:35] <LilStinker> imagine 90 Day Fiance if they showed all the gore and nudity that they usually cut out for US tv
[2:03:36] <goatshead> oh for real? newspaper titties? england is cool again
[2:03:36] <fermule> horny jesse is back
[2:03:43] <Pliny_theElder> what's next, a license to butter my toast in the morning?
[2:03:43] <buttson> you have to pass a written test to get a tv
[2:03:45] <sawks> horny jesse never went away
[2:03:54] <sixbynine> only the really really bad papers have titties
[2:03:55] <irregularmatt83> 007 has one of those

[2:04:10] <ApollOrc> eatchaBird
[2:04:11] <owlyoop> woo
[2:04:13] <farthammer1> We fetishize violence and are repulsed by sex. Europe fetishizes sex and is repulsed by violence. They have it right.

[2:04:27] <Pliny_theElder> did you guys watch love is blind? that's some real trash garbage
[2:04:35] <toilet_noise> US shows are just psychologically disgusting, rather than physically

[2:04:52] <funcle_leland> the US is fucked up, sorry

[2:05:11] <therudebeast> one time i heard a hilarious mp3 where bert and ernie toke up
[2:05:11] <AfroGunsou> what if big bird put a cigarette out on elmo
[2:05:11] <jazzisking> naturally i went to the imdb parents guide for naked attraction and it says "In one episode, the host has two people have sex live. The entire seen is clearly seen with plenty of closeups." how is that even real
[2:05:14] <bjork_liker> what if big bird did a drive by
[2:05:15] <munt69> what if you saw big bird nude on tv
[2:05:25] <tompeppre> 90 day fiance has psychological violence
[2:05:27] <aPerfectUrkel> europe has many times more smokers than the US
[2:05:30] <headlesspresident> big bird spread ass

[2:05:49] <funcle_leland> hurts no-one
[2:05:52] <the___community> what if big bird and cookie monster slap boxing
[2:05:53] <tescovaluegin> the worst UK show is "The Undateables" where the premise is literally just that they try to get a disabled person to go on dates
[2:05:58] <big_time_goofus> Big Bird’s gaping hole
[2:05:59] <pcarroll47> Big bird gets rejected after the genital portion
[2:06:09] <MarsIsWaiting> speaking of booty, how about that Megan Thee Stallion tweet huh, JF
[2:06:14] <swearholes> his nuts too good
[2:06:16] <Pliny_theElder> that's what jf said watching that show
[2:06:17] <therudebeast> he got eliminated because a little pee came out
[2:06:22] <tompeppre> they were showing the butt and he gaped
[2:06:27] <tjborg> boy I love a good boobie
[2:06:44] <notkaz> I haven't bought a fifa game for like six years and it's nice to know they're still recycling the same commentary lines

[2:09:50] <friggindummy> there aren'y many good shows
[2:09:52] <LilacWhimski> you dont have to pay much attention to a bad show
[2:09:53] <funcle_leland> do these boys have abs on their shirts
[2:09:55] <TaintEnthusiast> the perfect show is justified, it's bad and good at the same time
[2:09:59] <KBFella> i enjoy bad things but shows like that just make me feel awful for the people on them
[2:10:14] <MikeASchneider> everything except games imo
[2:10:18] <funcle_leland> dudes rock
[2:10:25] <jazzisking> pro soccer players usually don't have abs so it's good they put them on the kit there

[2:19:53] <bobricebobrice> i have ordered a few different masks
[2:19:59] <bobricebobrice> couple actually
[2:20:06] <tjborg> I would never send stefan a vr headset. seems unlikely
[2:20:10] <bobricebobrice> and none have arrived - very interesting, i say
[2:20:23] <eponeen> I ordered a Quest in March and it only took three weeks
[2:20:29] <pcarroll47> I feel like the giant hornet is large enough for me to just cream it out of the air with a baseball bat or tennis racket
[2:20:29] <ARealLifeBear> my package got delayed a few years ago when I ordered an Oculus Rift, and was able to squeeze a 20% discount out of Amazon lol
[2:20:36] <friggindummy> whats nice is that google promised to turn off all of the tracking measures they've been using for coronavirus so that is nice of them

[2:40:58] <NugCaleb> my niece is obsessed with Nailed It on netflix
[2:40:59] <ChuddTruckley> get them soulsilver or w/e
[2:41:07] <Cornetto_32> sword and shield would probably be good for kids, very linear
[2:41:07] <eponeen> one of my students wrote a paper for his final about how pokemon was too easy now
[2:41:18] <NugCaleb> she's 43

[2:41:38] <Down10_> they look like skeletons
[2:41:55] <bigboylittlecity> I think Winx is French
[2:41:59] <dropkickchannel> i'd rather watch Blinx: The Time Sweeper, exclusively on Microsoft Xbox
[2:42:04] <puzzlemustard> relatable
[2:42:08] <Deadlydog> they would like sailor moon
[2:42:13] <usernamehaver> there's a new powerpuff girls too
[2:42:15] <tjborg> the more hentai the better
[2:42:17] <CoolHand_Sean> do they like that one with the Cat Noir and the Lady Bug?
[2:42:18] <dropkickchannel> they did bring sailor moon back a couple years ago, it looked bad
[2:42:18] <farthammer1> They take on a team of bad guys and the bad guy is their dad? Are you watching my therapy sessions?????

[2:42:28] <tompeppre> screwloose
[2:42:32] <Source_Force> sailor moon is good. In the beginning it was very much a children's show
[2:42:32] <corn_hub> have they tried watching the Joe Rogan Experience?
[2:42:32] <TaintEnthusiast> disney channel is pedo trash
[2:42:33] <buttson> !venus
[2:42:34] <Nightbot> I am one of those people who believe in doing it right the first time. When I purchased my Venus, I bought all of the attachments available. I use the Head Massager for foreplay. If ‘Mr. Happy’ doesn’t want to play I ‘Pump’ up his ego. Then the Receiver strokes me into ecstasy. My partner loves her nipples massaged while she is riding her Sybian. Venus truly does it all! What fantastic products.
[2:42:35] <Down10_> They made a new Johnny Test and the animation is really really bad
[2:42:35] <BrainiacGoosy> oof i think i see what @Down10_ is talking about

[2:43:16] <considerthetetrapod> basically. it was good
[2:43:17] <eponeen> steven universe?
[2:43:18] <Down10_> She-Ra is not bad. I thought it would suck
[2:43:18] <farthammer1> New Thundercats has kiddie animation but the fight scenes rule
[2:43:19] <munt69> I liked it as a teen
[2:43:20] <rodzirvin> Thats Rick and Mortyish
[2:43:21] <lord_googoo> lord_googoo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! cait wrote on she-ra

[2:43:29] <xannyboy420> my daughter's a dealer actually
[2:43:32] <usernamehaver> Adventure Time is great for kids
[2:43:33] <considerthetetrapod> gravity falls is a GREAT kids show
[2:43:34] <Dealeylama> Recently learned Mike Golic’s brother was the RA from Saved By The Bell College Years
[2:43:35] <puzzlemustard> maybe a liiiiitle older?

[2:43:58] <TaintEnthusiast> scharpling is in it
[2:44:05] <Source_Force> adventure time grew into being for adults. the first few seasons are very kiddy
[2:44:09] <lord_googoo> Steven universe is cool
[2:44:09] <DoogieHowserSpankedMySon> nah its kid shit
[2:44:11] <eponeen> yeah they had steven universe deal with trauma
[2:44:12] <usernamehaver> Tom Scharpling is the dad!
[2:44:13] <munt69> it's good for kids, bad for adults
[2:44:13] <unitluna> that's all the show is
[2:44:16] <bobricebobrice> pathos
[2:44:18] <pecotaredux> It's good, but I'd stick to like the first two seasons for kids
[2:44:24] <considerthetetrapod> adventure time does really weird stuff. like AT takes place after an apocalypse and all this shit
[2:44:25] <ARealLifeBear> kingsKiki
[2:44:25] <Down10_> Steven Universe is fun, but it needed to end
[2:44:27] <dropkickchannel> There's not that much pathos, it's just adults watching that show and remembering the first time they got sad about being alive
[2:44:27] <sawks> kiki
