[0:14:21] <dmchandler> Fallout 4, a so-so game, but becomes an immersive fun shooter in VR
[0:14:26] <AfroGunsou> super. hot. super. hot. super. hot

[0:14:27] <420juuls> !jugjudy
[0:14:28] <McCainFlightSchool> poke them in the eye
[0:14:35] <oleskunty> oh yeah this game is dope
[0:14:37] <Timb0nic> @GoOffKings tell jesse he needs to dodge and Time Only Moves when He moves.

[0:14:54] <sawks> john wick, more like jesse wick amirite
[0:15:00] <wariobama> if you can do the thing where you set it up with your pc i highly recommend hot dogs horseshoes and hand grenades if you want to shoot guns
[0:15:02] <Timb0nic> you have to do the circle dance hands thing
[0:15:04] <ShroomsofDoom> the trick is to turn A/C on

[0:15:05] <Nightbot> https://clips.twitch.tv/FancyGracefulPorcupineFunRun
[0:15:07] <M_Go_Dead> it is a seductive dance
[0:15:09] <dmchandler> remember the capacitor sensors with your index controllers so you don't always need to grip, and if you grip you're making a fist
[0:15:09] <Timb0nic> do the high hopes dance to get them to move
[0:15:23] <tompeppre> this is what jfs normal vision looks like
[0:15:25] <PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Sunday Evening Revisited by Abstraction -> https://prtzl.to/3QHRXoY1c7
[0:15:30] <dmchandler> if you move at all, they move, so stay still and move SLOW to do slow mo
[0:15:33] <Timb0nic> @GoOffKings also you can block bullets with guns and other stuff
[0:15:37] <dmchandler> and hide behind counters and stuff
[0:15:41] <Grundle_Guy> I listened to a recent YKS where they talked about how dumb VR is and how you’ll never catch them in that shit 🤔🤔🤔🤔 Hippocrates much?

[0:16:47] <breuklyn> throw your shoe
[0:17:00] <ghoulsnightout_> Does it look more fun with the headset? This looks like ass
[0:17:00] <dmchandler> yeah Stef, some games do throwing well and some don't, and it's superhot's one weakness-- but you get the hang of the timing and can do long range tosses

[0:17:49] <dmchandler> VR is definitely one of those "gotta try it to see" things, which combined with the price makes adoption tough I imagine, but I can't get enuff of it
[0:17:51] <starkimified> when I played this at a friend's I accidentally punched a glass table

[0:18:35] <Nightbot> that's funny
[0:18:45] <dmchandler> and superhot doesn't even really utilize roomscale and all bad guys will be in front of you or to the side, games that use roomscale can be even more cuckoo
[0:18:49] <eponeen> Jesse is going to get tired of it before he's out of the tutorial
[0:18:58] <mikelenehan> lol
[0:19:01] <AfroGunsou> i forget, is superhot one of those games you can grab the bullets in the air?
[0:19:05] <MyHeroZer0> tell him stay on cam

[0:19:19] <WealthyWalrus> This game rocks but can get immensely frustrating when you end up having to do the same room like 100 times
[0:19:20] <PoopyDickens> @kolbotn yes

[0:42:18] <Down10_> It hasn't
[0:42:19] <farthammer1> Neither has the comic

[0:43:05] <ARealLifeBear> PSVR is pretty legit
[0:43:07] <Timb0nic> @joshdavisj for the price the PSVR has some totally worthwhile games
[0:43:08] <bloviated> at the end of the movie after sniping Morgan Freeman he looks to the camera and says "what the fuck have you done today?"

[0:44:10] <carpenter_groot> remember when he hits his coworker in the face with the key board and the letters fly toward the screen and spell out "fuck you"?
[0:44:11] <naffologist> the wanted soundtrack had a very good danny elfman song on it, and that makes the movie and comic worth it for me

[0:45:41] <joshdavisj> Is the best way to get a quest just wait for their website to notify you that they’re back in stock?
[0:45:46] <machopineapple> play real vr fisting
[0:45:50] <sawks> oh man a vr trucking simulator would be rad
[0:45:50] <dmchandler> Lone Echo the single player game is cool, and Echo VR the multiplayer game is fun too
[0:45:55] <farthammer1> JF are you holding the gun to the side like a Bad MF? That rules
[0:45:55] <ANDYCHILIPARTY> wait for it
[0:45:57] <harrytomlomsom> Echo is cool if you want a bunch of 13 year olds beating your ass at space frisbee

[0:46:53] <Megaspel> VR is sorta still a bad investment for game dev
[0:46:57] <congeeman> nord vpn comes with vr mlb the show
[0:47:01] <RevRagu> i think corona is probably the vr killer app
[0:47:11] <dmchandler> the market is still small, just like 1.5% of steam users... but it's so damn fun
[0:47:19] <owlyoop> he sliced a dang bullet
[0:47:21] <sawks> slice that bullet hell ya
[0:47:21] <dylbobobbins> a big investment for devs with little return

[0:49:38] <bloviated> Stefan if you wear a beanie does it fit?
[0:49:45] <splinkerbell> thumper?
[0:49:48] <Megaspel> elite dangerous is pretty decent in VR
[0:49:48] <tjborg> Stefan your head is too smooth, thats why the strap is slipping
[0:49:50] <sawks> they should make farming sim vr
[0:49:51] <AfroGunsou> redout?
[0:49:54] <Jazzahn> vtor vr is sick
[0:49:54] <tompeppre> look up x plane stefan
[0:49:56] <NziechOpossum> EVE Valkyrie
[0:49:58] <RevRagu> yeah redout
[0:49:58] <harrytomlomsom> did you see the VR experiment where its jenga but every time you place a block your fingers get longer
[0:50:00] <dmchandler> they have dogfighting flying games in VR, the main ones use it
[0:50:01] <ARealLifeBear> Thumper is incredible in VR
[0:50:03] <farthammer1> Walking down Harlem streets at 2am and a mugger tries to attack me and I throw a wine bottle at him and he easily dodges it and stabs me 42 times
[0:50:03] <TheGreatCactusJac> gunkata time
[0:50:05] <dmchandler> but they're more sim-y
[0:50:09] <Megaspel> elite dangerous is also boring though imo
[0:50:10] <chrome_chomsky> i would get an arma style vr game, that would be nuts
[0:50:11] <harrytomlomsom> oh fuck THUMPER yes
[0:50:16] <drippedout> il-2 in vr fucking rocks
[0:50:20] <spaceshiplaw> jesse you might have covered this but have you had any like motion sickness issues
[0:50:23] <Jazzahn> VTOL VR is a great flight sim thats purpose built for vr
[0:50:24] <dmchandler> I like Elite Dangerous in VR a lot but it takes time to learn, prolly not good for the stream
[0:50:24] <PretzelRocks> Now Playing: BuffLyfe by Popskyy -> https://prtzl.to/GRHPGkEws8
[0:50:25] <bighowellandpossum> do they have a game where you get shot over and over by some red naked guys
[0:50:33] <ARealLifeBear> oh yeah, NMS is good
[0:50:34] <dmchandler> NMS in VR is cool, and you can multiplayer it
[0:50:38] <carpenter_groot> Elite Dangerous in VR looks awesome
[0:50:41] <tompeppre> when i get a headset first thing im doing is elite lol

[0:52:13] <splinkerbell> @GoOffKings so what kind of VR rigs did you all get?
[0:52:17] <dmchandler> if anyone already owns Subnautica, that's cool in VR, but no motion controls
[0:52:18] <Timb0nic> Breast butt and genital editing sweet
[0:52:21] <Aestro17> I can already do that
[0:52:25] <harrytomlomsom> gonna get myself a long ass
[0:52:26] <BloodWorms> i want a tiny hog and huge balls
[0:52:27] <donromney> you know i'm gonna put two dicks on there
[0:52:31] <TheGreatCactusJac> Giving yourself 2 butts
[0:52:32] <wiiinks> JF's instinct is to crouch cowardly instead of bravely launching himself at the combatants
[0:52:33] <cosmocat69> Come on I wanna see Jempys weird hog
[0:52:34] <Timb0nic> gonna make a chick with huge oves
[0:52:38] <ARealLifeBear> yipes
[0:52:40] <harrytomlomsom> dick on the front dick on the back
[0:52:46] <braddawson> gonna find a way to get a third labia

[0:53:14] <sawks> should i wait for rift s to come back in stock or get the quest
[0:53:14] <Timb0nic> I wonder how TOS-friendly CyberPunk will actually be
[0:53:18] <chrome_chomsky> when do you think cyberpunk will actually be out
[0:53:26] <splinkerbell> makes sense
[0:53:28] <spennyspennyspenny> i think it's only like 2 months in us
[0:53:35] <dmchandler> the Quest is tempting tho so I can bring it to friends's houses while also connecting it to my computer
[0:53:36] <bad_boy_bubby> is this a stefan solo stream
[0:53:37] <harrytomlomsom> @Timb0nic they only actually censor small queer stuff they dont give a shit about TOS
[0:53:38] <Aestro17> Do you play as Keanu or is he just in the game?
[0:53:38] <joshdavisj> Where did you order the quest?
[0:53:43] <zeroanaphora> I played VR at a theme park in the 90s
[0:53:46] <ARealLifeBear> Cyberpunk might have a streamer mode, would probably be the best compromise

[0:55:01] <migrainethresher> i doubt the sex scenes will be any more involved than in The Witcher 3
[0:55:01] <IIIRemy> doesnt twitch allow it in a game?
[0:55:03] <harrytomlomsom> @Timb0nic theyve not kicked up a fuss about the Witcher or anything im pretty sure. like. Cyberpunk is gonna be enough of a money maker that theyre gonna ignore the TOS for it

[0:55:28] <dmchandler> @eponeen I don't believe so, you need the directlink cable thing to do regular PC VR on the Quest, and without it you "only" have the Oculus library
[0:55:44] <Timb0nic> true
[0:55:47] <snes_classic_chalmers> oculus quest: canada post tested and approved
[0:55:48] <yeeeeeeboiiii> you just can bring to much attention to it. if you redo a sex scene 10 times your probably gonna get banned. otherwise your fine.
[0:55:49] <breuklyn> when the time comes you won' t have to
[0:55:54] <dmchandler> @eponeen there may be a streaming option I am unaware of but as far as I know, you need the cable
[0:55:54] <yeeeeeeboiiii> can't
[0:55:54] <bad_boy_bubby> jesee the guy!!!
[0:55:55] <harrytomlomsom> if you wanna make a small weird suggestive queer game with no real nudity? that's a ban.
[0:55:56] <migrainethresher> even if there was full penetration twitch would make an exception, or CDPR would put in a streamer toggle

[1:02:07] <Nightbot> This steam's cool, but I wish there was a way to find the geeks and gamers in the crowd.
[1:02:08] <Chexoid> subnautica VR might be neat
[1:02:16] <dmchandler> definitely NMS in VR, you're in the ships, the game is much better than at launch, the worlds, going under water, its more than worth trying
[1:02:19] <sixbynine> its good now but I don't know that it's a Jesse game
[1:02:21] <buttbuttpeeman> no man's sky is a new game now. it's pretty cool
[1:02:23] <bjork_liker> Get Elite Dangerous
[1:02:26] <sawks> o fuck subnautica vr would legit give me a panic attack
[1:02:27] <dmchandler> subnautica is real cool in VR, and included with the base game
[1:02:29] <Timb0nic> Mind Control powers
[1:02:35] <Megaspel> I found it really hard to do the blowing up thing

[1:15:45] <man_brother> Can you curve the bullet in this like wanted?
[1:15:46] <dmchandler> @doosteroo the first one is mainly exploring and swinging around like spiderman, and the 2nd adds bow and arrow and bad guys to it
[1:15:46] <metalgearlenin> JF more like James Bond with that pose
[1:16:06] <zednaught> someone should make that
[1:16:12] <man_brother> Followup: Is wanted a Jesse movie?
[1:16:19] <JoeBushDotNet> This does show that there would be significant interest in a Wanted VR game
[1:16:26] <LaOwlLOL> JF doing gunkata like that guy in that movie.
[1:16:26] <zednaught> wanted is also a movie about jesse
[1:16:31] <zednaught> people want him
[1:16:44] <dmchandler> the only biggish VR game i wouldn't recommend is Doom VR, they messed it up
[1:16:51] <dmchandler> but Doom 3 with the VR mod is rad!
[1:16:58] <dmchandler> has motion controls and everything\
[1:17:07] <doosteroo> i had a good time with Doom vfr but the controls on ps4 are wonky
[1:17:11] <rodzirvin> Jesse is bustin caps

[1:19:04] <buttbuttpeeman> Big Van Vader?
[1:19:05] <dmchandler> @eponeen its okay, I don't like recommending it cuz its more just an "experience" and its not cheap
[1:19:10] <LaOwlLOL> this is Equilibrium
[1:19:16] <dmchandler> the vader game is only worth while when on sale for way cheap
[1:19:20] <Timb0nic> Jesse: We have an unknown spacecraft on radar Captain DB: Blast em
[1:19:24] <dmchandler> its not BAD its just not much of a game
[1:19:29] <metalgearlenin> Three chapters to vader's quest? what is it the prequels?
[1:19:33] <owlyoop> i like how the ragdoll on the 2nd level gets more fucked up each time
[1:19:37] <eponeen> I kind of bought my headset to bring around and show to other people so I am kind of into collecting experiences
[1:19:42] <wiiinks> Captain DB, barely audibly: "red alert"
[1:19:54] <dmchandler> @eponeen vader would be good for showing new people VR, that'd be a fun use for it
[1:20:01] <Timb0nic> lol @wiiinks
[1:20:01] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:20:10] <migrainethresher> there's a free droid repair game that's pretty simple, but fun

[1:50:55] <literalsunbear> jug judy, jug judy... where have I heard that before
[1:50:57] <MyHeroZer0> potato cakes awe awesome
[1:51:00] <considerthetetrapod> hardees has better curly fries
[1:51:03] <dumassolay> good sauce options at arbys
[1:51:04] <cn_monoxide> It harms you worse than other fast food though. It’s so heavy
[1:51:05] <dmchandler> i haven't been to one in decades but the sandwiches were normal to me
[1:51:08] <Megaspel> burger kings sucks so bad in england
[1:51:10] <completebreakfast> agree
[1:51:11] <sawks> burger king is back
[1:51:11] <eugene_v_dabs> i was volunteering with an organization working some aspect of the big event
[1:51:11] <considerthetetrapod> burger king is awful
[1:51:11] <Megaspel> at least at every train station
[1:51:12] <europeansheep> no it sucks
[1:51:12] <kolbotn> theres no Arbys here
[1:51:12] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> the problem with arby's is that the bad locations are horrid to the point where i think they actually drive the average down
[1:51:12] <MikeASchneider> have you had the impossible burger at BK stefan
[1:51:13] <BasementHippo> it is no more or less objectionable than any other fast food joint. Except for Burger King, which is by far the most objectionable. BK sucks ass
[1:51:13] <LilacWhimski> burger king is awful
[1:51:14] <zany_antics> nope it sucks
[1:51:14] <AfroGunsou> arbys is good
[1:51:14] <carpenter_groot> burger king is ass
[1:51:15] <khajimak> bUrGeR kInG iS bAcK
[1:51:17] <itsmikeo> BK is a mixed bag
[1:51:18] <sawks> impossible whopper
[1:51:18] <tompeppre> i heard a story that arbys keep their beef in state where if it gets warm it liquifies
[1:51:18] <dmchandler> burger king used to be great, then it sucked for a long time, and recently is okay apparently
[1:51:19] <tjborg> BK sucks everywhere
[1:51:19] <khajimak> BK sucks
[1:51:22] <LilacWhimski> burger king is always bad
[1:51:23] <Timb0nic> Burger King was good in the 90s/early 2000s but now they kinda suck shit
[1:51:24] <eugene_v_dabs> it was a picnic atmosphere and lots of donors were out
[1:51:24] <itsmikeo> impossible whopper slaps
[1:51:25] <zany_antics> I worked at a burger king in high school lmao. it blows
[1:51:27] <MyHeroZer0> Burger King has great breakfast and everything else is garbage
[1:51:27] <swappingspit> burger king is the worst food made anywhere
[1:51:28] <dmchandler> when I was a kid, the whopper was awesome
[1:51:29] <MikeASchneider> the tacos are just nasty
[1:51:30] <buttbuttpeeman> BK is shit worldwide
[1:51:31] <Chexoid> its both a dollar and a pound bargain
[1:51:33] <TheGreatCactusJac> nasty tacos
[1:51:35] <itsmikeo> nuggs are meh but super cheap
[1:51:37] <sawks> i've never had jack in the box
[1:51:37] <Down10_> Jack in the Box is okay!
[1:51:38] <PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Rise by Ampyx -> https://prtzl.to/3QHRXeXdF7
[1:51:39] <oldnick42> I think Burger King varies more than any other fast food place.
[1:51:40] <tjborg> there's a reason you can get 10 nuggets for $1 at BK
[1:51:43] <dmchandler> the impossible whopper aint bad at all!
[1:51:43] <eugene_v_dabs> and so this guy walks up to me while i'm helping park cars and he says "workin hard or hardly workin?"
[1:51:46] <buttbuttpeeman> Doughboys
[1:51:46] <sharkbutt> i wanted to try the impossible whopper until i heard it tastes just like a regular whopper
[1:51:47] <oldnick42> Jack in the Box, at least in California, is good.
[1:51:50] <eugene_v_dabs> and i'm like, who is this asshole?

[1:51:52] <wiiinks> BK's long chicken sandwich is the only good thing they have
[1:51:53] <foygus_> zesty sauce
[1:51:58] <zeroanaphora> I like BK chicken bc it's oblong
[1:52:01] <eugene_v_dabs> so i said "volunteerin'"
[1:52:01] <owlyoop> i am a child because every night i look forward to eating an ice cream sandwich
[1:52:08] <BasementHippo> BK was the only 24 hour restaurant in town when I went to college and that should have been considered a human rights violation
[1:52:10] <dmchandler> wendys was great here in Oregon growing up
[1:52:11] <khajimak> wow
[1:52:11] <europeansheep> no burger meat at wendys
[1:52:12] <itsmikeo> oof harsh take by JF
[1:52:15] <tompeppre> i had wendys recently and they have gone way downhill
[1:52:16] <eugene_v_dabs> and then my buddy introduced me and i went home and never went back there
[1:52:16] <zeroanaphora> I used to think Wendy's was the best but last 12 times I went there it sucked
[1:52:17] <LilacWhimski> i haven't had wendys in over 1- years
[1:52:17] <Dealeylama> Burger King is based where i live, my parents house is literally on a street called Whopper Way
[1:52:20] <LilacWhimski> 10 years*
[1:52:21] <yarightdude> wendys is garbage now
[1:52:21] <goodfriendjake> Stefan a while ago on Blocked Party y'all had a top three worst atmospheres and my number one is Burger King. The one in my hometown is fucked. It's right on the beach and smells like pure bleach. It's like a hospital
[1:52:22] <twotontesticle> Had some Bojangles today. Pretty good
[1:52:23] <dumassolay> no
[1:52:23] <tjborg> yeah :/
[1:52:25] <wiiinks> Wendy's ain't got no burgs rn!
[1:52:25] <tompeppre> spicy chicken is ass now
[1:52:26] <sawks> taco bell is the only fast food i eat
[1:52:28] <yarightdude> been like that for a while unfortunately
[1:52:29] <its_doggety> Jesses right, Wendy’s isn’t great
[1:52:29] <AfroGunsou> I'm going to bat for rallys/checkers
[1:52:30] <ourfriendZin> good shit jf
[1:52:32] <Fargabarga> Burger King > Wendys
[1:52:32] <dumassolay> that sandwich sucks a wet mess
[1:52:33] <braddawson> i like the burgers :(
[1:52:33] <artdamage> our A&W shares a buidling with Longjohn Silver
[1:52:33] <khajimak> there's 2 wendys in my town and the one by me sucks but the other is good
[1:52:34] <00nola> spicy nuggets are the only good thing
[1:52:35] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> i've had some real bad experiences with wendy's recently
[1:52:35] <LaOwlLOL> wendy's has indeed fallen off
[1:52:38] <jucherobinson> spicy chicken whips but popeyes crushed them
[1:52:38] <dmchandler> i've been losing weight for a while so i haven't had fast food in a few years
[1:52:41] <Smanchburger> I had two spicy chickens the other night and they tasted amazing but the next day I was on the toilet for 8 hours
[1:52:41] <00nola> no one else has the spicy nugs
[1:52:41] <ourfriendZin> taco bell rocks
[1:52:42] <farthammer1> INCORRECT
[1:52:42] <turnpike74> Spicy ain’t good anymore
[1:52:43] <howintensive> mcdonalds or taco bell
[1:52:47] <its_doggety> @afrogunsou yes
[1:52:48] <leedo_> cheesy gordita crunch
[1:52:49] <sawks> easily eat veg at taco bell
[1:52:49] <dmchandler> yes
[1:52:49] <Timb0nic> fuck Chic Fil A .... but their sandwich is absolutely incredible
[1:52:52] <leedo_> want one
[1:52:53] <JoeBushDotNet> My mother calls it "Taco Smell"
[1:52:53] <LilacWhimski> taco bell is fine, mcdonalds is exactly what you think it will be every time
[1:52:58] <CovfefeDobson> subway is the best
[1:52:58] <00nola> if someone else did spicy nuggets wendys would go out of business
[1:53:01] <tjborg> lol what is canada

[1:53:04] <supimscott> Taco Bell has fallen off!
[1:53:06] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> taco bell is choice
[1:53:06] <dumassolay> taco bell has these new potato tacos that are good
[1:53:10] <matt6965> did they lose the fast food wars?
[1:53:10] <sawks> stefan are there taco times in vancouver
[1:53:10] <oldnick42> What's with Taco Bell getting rid of the beef chalupa?

[1:53:21] <munt69> taco bell has bad beans
[1:53:22] <dumassolay> its a tator tot taco
[1:53:22] <europeansheep> cookout unreal
[1:53:22] <DavidFosterFlawless> its just the same ingredients mixed in different ways
[1:53:23] <itsmikeo> del taco rips
[1:53:23] <LaOwlLOL> Wendy's started going down hill when they switched from 5 piece chicken nuggets to a 4 piece wth
[1:53:24] <TheGreatCactusJac> They got rid of beef chalupas?!
[1:53:25] <DavidFosterFlawless> but its good
[1:53:26] <AfroGunsou> I will get taco bell more than any other fast food however
[1:53:29] <serpentine666> del is great
[1:53:29] <turnpike74> The combo Taco Bell kfc are common here and they are much worse
[1:53:29] <JoeBushDotNet> The Del Taco by my house is my favorite restaurant
[1:53:30] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> if you're hungry but don't want to spend a lot you can just get like half a dozen soft tacos for 10 bucks
[1:53:30] <Dealeylama> Zaxbys blows other chicken places all out of the water, not even close for me
[1:53:31] <zeroanaphora> Del taco
[1:53:33] <zany_antics> del taco grilled chicken tacos are insanely good
[1:53:34] <dmchandler> i like the fried cheese curds at A&W, we got them in Oregon
[1:53:37] <sawks> taco time bad
[1:53:38] <oldnick42> Del Taco taco + fries is so hard to beat.
[1:53:38] <sharkbutt> nah
[1:53:39] <BasementHippo> taco bell has not gotten rid of the beef chalupa that is a disgusting baseless rumor
[1:53:42] <artdamage> burger king had 10 nugs for a fuckin dollar at one point
[1:53:42] <nasty_nasty_nasty> taco bell is a greyhound-exclusive joint for me. only when my greyhound bus stops there
[1:53:43] <supimscott> I had the tripleupa today and it was fucking terrible
[1:53:43] <leedo_> anne's frozen burrito?
[1:53:43] <HunkForHire> del taco gives you a lot of food for a little too
[1:53:44] <donromney> del taco, sucks
[1:53:45] <zeroanaphora> fuck you assholes now I'm hungry
[1:53:45] <HunkForHire> fries are a1
[1:53:46] <wiiinks> My friend got food poisoning from subway on a road trip and it forced him to shit in a mcdonald's urinal
[1:53:48] <itsmikeo> the salsa chicken tacos at del taco are phenomenal
[1:53:48] <dmlat> Burger King is undoubtably the worst national brand yes
[1:53:48] <dmchandler> taco time is more expensive and not as good as taco bell to me
[1:53:48] <farthammer1> My wife got us McDonald's lunch a few days ago and it was the first time I have had it in at least 8 years. Tastes EXACTLY the same. B-.

[1:54:02] <itsmikeo> secret to del taco is don't order their regular combo menu items
[1:54:02] <zeroanaphora> best fast food in canada is the places in montreal with poutine
[1:54:02] <dmchandler> i loved A&W growing up here in Oregon
[1:54:03] <JoeBushDotNet> Do you have Chez Ashton on the west coast
[1:54:04] <dumassolay> there are some good ones
[1:54:09] <nasty_nasty_nasty> the potato oles at taco johns are insanely good but i think its only in the midwest
[1:54:09] <artdamage> i like the little corn dogs at AW
[1:54:09] <braddawson> a&w burgers are so dry
[1:54:10] <sawks> i had a&w in vancouver and it was so good
[1:54:12] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> Culver's is still king. fight me
[1:54:17] <LaOwlLOL> all fast food in the U.S. varies by location

[1:54:34] <zeroanaphora> like a certain co-host, I've never had a big mac
[1:54:34] <europeansheep> there are really bad mcdonalds tho
[1:54:35] <buttbuttpeeman> Fries at my local McDonald's suck shit
[1:54:35] <Megaspel> no mcdonalds is open in my hometown and they dont do delivery either
[1:54:37] <LilacWhimski> the quarter pounder is a decent burger
[1:54:38] <eugene_v_dabs> @oprah_gangnam_style frozen custard is for perverts

[1:54:52] <dmchandler> I never had mcdonalds growing up but as an adult I think it's not bad, I like the mcchicken when tomato added
[1:54:53] <Chexoid> jesse those chops king
[1:54:54] <nasty_nasty_nasty> yeah culvers is obviously the best but its so regional
[1:54:54] <CovfefeDobson> a&w and subway are top 2
[1:54:56] <oldnick42> @BasementHippo They haven't had it at the one near me in southern california the last two times I've been there. It's something I always order. It's fucked.
[1:54:57] <wiiinks> McDonald's is sincerely delicious
[1:54:57] <dmchandler> cheap and yum
[1:54:58] <artdamage> i go to A&W/LongJohns and get chicken planks with mini corndogs and then have a stroke
[1:54:59] <pariah_doggy> Loved A&W growing up. The one we have here is a KFC/A&W combo and it blows
[1:55:03] <BasementHippo> mcdonalds doesn't suck fuck you its good

[1:55:40] <dmchandler> i get 3 or 4 thingies of it and bring it home
[1:55:40] <Juicerosmith> I would go hungry before eating subway
[1:55:41] <matt6965> garbage
[1:55:44] <BasementHippo> and subway is easily at the bottom of the sandwich categeory
[1:55:45] <artdamage> the bread is so weird
[1:55:45] <mikefossey> i worked at subway you can get a nice sandwich there
[1:55:45] <europeansheep> I miss when quiznos was good
[1:55:46] <oldnick42> I did a drive-thru Subway on a 12 hour road trip recently. That was good.
[1:55:47] <CovfefeDobson> everyone online hates it but its awesome
[1:55:47] <sharkbutt> the worst sandwich place by a mile
[1:55:48] <serpentine666> stefan loves the tuna marinara and olives
[1:55:49] <00nola> stefan ill fuck with some subway
[1:55:50] <farthammer1> Cold CUCK Combo is more like it
[1:55:51] <zeroanaphora> what happened to Quiznos
[1:55:52] <DrOrpheusMD> Jersey mikes
[1:55:57] <owlyoop> i only get the meatball sub from subway
[1:55:58] <farthammer1> I can hear Jesse
[1:55:59] <sawks> quiznos died
[1:56:00] <Its_Endless_Mike> Subway: Now That's Edible
[1:56:01] <khajimak> Jersey Mike's rules
[1:56:02] <europeansheep> quiznos got too big too fast
[1:56:02] <LaOwlLOL> Jersey Mikes.
[1:56:03] <egregiousfuqup> worse than any sammy I've ever made
[1:56:03] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> the pizza melt is the only reason to go to subvway and pretty much everywhere else does it better
[1:56:04] <MikeASchneider> lmao
[1:56:04] <Nightbot> lol
[1:56:05] <zany_antics> its not fast food maybe but shit potbelly's is barely more expensive and much much better
[1:56:08] <Dealeylama> Do alot of subways have touch screen drive thrus?
[1:56:08] <buttbuttpeeman> cold cut combo has like 1/2ounce of meat on it. fuckin ridiculous
[1:56:09] <chrome_chomsky> !rip quiznos
[1:56:09] <Nightbot> RIP Jesse's controller
[1:56:11] <zednaught> we all love a tuna marinara from subway
[1:56:12] <owlyoop> Subway went downhill ever since we lost Jared
[1:56:13] <McCainFlightSchool> the nostalgia of eating a tuna mariana sub
[1:56:16] <rodzirvin> What's the consensus on KFC?
[1:56:17] <ourfriendZin> potbelly rocks
[1:56:18] <completebreakfast> the first time I had subway as a kid it was so damn good
[1:56:21] <BasementHippo> Jersey Mikes rules, potbelly is very good, quiznos is very good to the extent it still exists. Subway sucks ass
[1:56:22] <artdamage> subway was good like 15 years ago
[1:56:22] <nasty_nasty_nasty> when i was really broke and lived by a subway i would go there instead of actually eating out because it was so cheap
[1:56:22] <M_Go_Dead> 50% too much bread on any subway sub
[1:56:26] <considerthetetrapod> shout out to the yello sub in lawrence kansas for being the best sub sandwich place
[1:56:27] <LilacWhimski> nothing beats a tuna marinara by a campfire
[1:56:30] <drippedout> we always got subway when we were done camping too and i have a distinct memory that it fucking sucked ass
[1:56:30] <zeroanaphora> KFC has those thicc fries
[1:56:31] <DrOrpheusMD> KFC sucks shit now
[1:56:32] <JoeBushDotNet> Is Mr. Goodcents available outside of the kansas city metropolitan area
[1:56:32] <egregiousfuqup> potbelly destroys both Jimmy John and Subway
[1:56:35] <dumassolay> Runza
[1:56:35] <artdamage> original subway was really good
[1:56:36] <Chexoid> Jesse has already won the mental battle before the game has begun
[1:56:38] <supimscott> So what’s good at Taco Bell anymore? There’s no good menu items anymore
[1:56:40] <coach_mike_dan_tony> my secret shame is that I still like the meatball sub from subway
[1:56:45] <farthammer1> Stefan is nostalgic for Subway - he misses the days when Jared was their spokesperson
[1:56:46] <pariah_doggy> Cousin’s Subs vastly superior
[1:56:47] <literalsunbear> mention fast food, guaranteed chat engagement
[1:56:52] <BasementHippo> @supimscott cheesy gordita crunch

[1:57:11] <dmchandler> subway was the only thing open when walking home from a restaurant job i had, late at night, and it wasn't bad sammiches
[1:57:14] <supimscott> @BasementHippo the fake cheese is bad
[1:57:16] <dmchandler> not great but fine andit was open
[1:57:17] <farthammer1> lol

[1:57:17] <rodzirvin> The chops are slammin
[1:57:20] <DrOrpheusMD> Chalupa from the bell when fresh hits so hard
[1:57:23] <europeansheep> nice wood floors
[1:57:35] <rodzirvin> 3 piece from KFC is good in a pinch
[1:57:39] <BasementHippo> buddy if you got a problem with fake cheese you're in the wrong neighborhood

[1:58:26] <eponeen> yes
[1:58:27] <matt6965> oh yeah
[1:58:27] <europeansheep> yes
[1:58:27] <sawks> @Dealeylama best chicken in the game
[1:58:28] <dmchandler> waffle house was so greasy, and i love grease, but it was too much
[1:58:29] <bcjette> way above dennys
[1:58:29] <LilacWhimski> waffle house is great if you are on a road trip
[1:58:30] <wwardlaw> Yeah, not fancier just more solid
[1:58:31] <LRonFrancis> yes way above
[1:58:32] <zany_antics> waffle house is good but at this point it's wildly overrated
[1:58:33] <markovblanket> waffle house kicks ass
[1:58:33] <LilacWhimski> way above dennys
[1:58:35] <MikeASchneider> how does waffle house compare to ihop
[1:58:35] <WheezTheSnus> waffle house is amazing
[1:58:36] <DrOrpheusMD> I oddly like Cracker Barrel
[1:58:37] <LaOwlLOL> waffle house is best
[1:58:37] <dmchandler> dennys is at the bottom for the national diners
[1:58:39] <zany_antics> much better than denny's
[1:58:40] <ARealLifeBear> Waffle House is very consistent
[1:58:42] <BasementHippo> is it above ihop?
[1:58:42] <artdamage> Waffle House > IHOP > Dennys

[1:58:45] <McCainFlightSchool> cracker barrel is good
[1:58:45] <JoeBushDotNet> Waffle House is less pretentious than Denny's, if that makes sense
[1:58:46] <rodzirvin> I HATE Cracker barrel
[1:58:47] <Smanchburger> Waffle House is good because its so cheap. Denny's is not cheap
[1:58:47] <Dealeylama> Dont know about the rest of the menu but chicken fingers and zax sauce is the best food on earth
[1:58:48] <sawks> ihop sucks ass
[1:58:48] <AfroGunsou> we have a ton of waffle houses here and I have no good feelings toward them

[2:37:43] <bighowellandpossum> if you were making uncut gems. don't you think you'd shoot a happy ending where he gets the money and gets laid. just to have that ending
[2:38:01] <slow_biden> why do you own so many fucking plates
[2:38:04] <Ohboymb> i would have added a second uncut gem

[2:38:49] <monju125> Theory: Irene thinks the blender is the dishwasher and that's why the dishes keep breaking.
