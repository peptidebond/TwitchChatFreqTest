[0:07:47] <ARealLifeBear> sounds like a cannon is shooting him out
[0:07:52] <Down10_> that jump has a lot of trajectory
[0:07:56] <Cornetto_32> what's up kings
[0:07:58] <dmchandler> i've had dogs who would fall out a window
[0:07:58] <hi_im_doug> is he going through the screen?
[0:08:00] <AfroGunsou> the noise is the screen ripping
[0:08:01] <Timb0nic> The blinds @GoOffKings
[0:08:03] <BloodWorms> could be blinds
[0:08:04] <ian_allman> little dogs little brains
[0:08:05] <cowboy_baby42> i have a big dog and he is pretty stupid too
[0:08:05] <AfroGunsou> for sure
[0:08:05] <mediumlizard> sounds like he busted the screen
[0:08:07] <buttson> sound of dogs nails scraping as it goes out
[0:08:07] <skipmuldoon> this is fake as fuck
[0:08:08] <dmchandler> could be blinds
[0:08:09] <sawks> oh yeah blinds
[0:08:10] <vervionline> im vervi
[0:08:15] <Land_Phil> why are filming from this angle in the first place?
[0:08:19] <AfroGunsou> im very glad its okay
[0:08:26] <Timb0nic> it looks real in air ....
[0:08:28] <dmchandler> it's flailing though
[0:08:29] <sawks> hmmmmm
[0:08:29] <Timb0nic> it looks super real
[0:08:30] <dmchandler> in the air
[0:08:31] <olanderic> no that dog is wiggling its damn legs and arms
[0:08:31] <Down10_> Oh yeah, there could be an edit
[0:08:35] <Clopsy> looks like a security cam
[0:08:36] <bloviated> feels fake the lighting slightly changes
[0:08:40] <Land_Phil> from this angle though?
[0:08:44] <dmchandler> could be a part of a security cam package
[0:08:45] <Land_Phil> it just shows the sidewalk
[0:08:47] <dmchandler> its not the only cam
[0:08:48] <TheGreatCactusJac> I don't know how it didn't break its legs
[0:08:49] <secretmysteryclub> The tree isn't moving in the first section
[0:08:49] <Timb0nic> We need Captain Disillusion on this shit
[0:08:51] <bloviated> feels like the exposure changes mid take
[0:08:53] <Land_Phil> bad angle for secuity in this case~
[0:08:58] <man_brother> that could be a recent extension brother
[0:08:59] <exojungle> fake
[0:09:00] <dmchandler> thats the cam for the parking lot
[0:09:01] <cosmocat69> To keep an eye on their cars. I used to get my tires slashed and had a camera just like this
[0:09:04] <Down10_> That's a brilliant fake, if true
[0:09:04] <skipmuldoon> a dog would break its legs from that height
[0:09:05] <dmchandler> there'd be another for the door/etc
[0:09:05] <Land_Phil> i call fake!
[0:09:10] <olanderic> theres something we cant see it lands on maybe
[0:09:12] <CerberusSystem> it would just be a classic texas switch
[0:09:13] <exojungle> doesnt matter\
[0:09:18] <depitts> the dog would break a leg or something
[0:09:18] <sawks> i don't think so
[0:09:25] <Timb0nic> The dog is fuckin fine lol
[0:09:26] <MikeASchneider> you could composite that if you had to
[0:09:28] <Land_Phil> fake news!
[0:09:28] <olanderic> i mean watch it as it flies
[0:09:29] <Down10_> they still could have matted out that side of the screen
[0:09:30] <dmchandler> the wide angle on the cam makes the fall look further also i think
[0:09:32] <depitts> gotta be fake
[0:09:34] <lil_pookie_c> this is doggy blair witch project
[0:09:37] <pbostrom> they could still release the dog out of frame
[0:09:37] <sawks> oh true @MikeASchneider
[0:09:37] <chrome_chomsky> falling too fast to be stuffed
[0:09:40] <frob_bongzales> look at the shadow of the top of the tree
[0:09:42] <dmchandler> a small dog could
[0:09:43] <cosmocat69> That dogs legs are too short to survive that
[0:09:44] <coldslaw69> this is like the show, The Capture, on BBC
[0:09:46] <BloodWorms> it's a little dog landing on grass, it could be fine
[0:09:48] <chrome_chomsky> little dogs are like cats
[0:09:54] <bloviated> is this what Twitter was talking about today
[0:09:57] <exojungle> it would roll like 5 feet on the ground
[0:09:58] <dogwontstopnuttingHELP> i think i cracked it. it's simply reversed footage of a dog walking backwards and jumping into a window
[0:09:59] <PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Echo by T&III -> https://prtzl.to/pYHldgaVTV
[0:10:01] <Down10_> there's no way a dog that size could walk from that fall so fast

[0:10:07] <steveearlesweatshirt> theres also an incline
[0:10:08] <dmchandler> yeah, it's a wide angle lens, it's like a 1st floor window with steps or something (maybe)
[0:10:11] <Land_Phil> very convient that the camera is positioned a way that makes this hard to prove!

[0:39:21] <MikeASchneider> lol
[0:39:23] <estcejai> unfollow everyone and start from scratch with nice bird accounts
[0:39:25] <listenerdave> you mean with a cloth? @skipmuldoon

[0:41:37] <party_bread> the one you hate
[0:41:38] <orbsee> let stefan delete your account at some point next week with no notice
[0:41:40] <Mangoblin> a good way to delete your twitter is to tweet that you're going to mail anthrax to joe biden. that got mine deleted.
[0:41:43] <dmchandler> is the doja cat altright edge lord stuff real, i didn't dig into it
[0:41:47] <gweeedo> i'll always think its you when i see rob rousseau liked a tweet

[0:42:15] <rodzirvin> Rob, go out in a blaze of glory, copyright strikes and cursing at people so you get banned
[0:42:16] <xLargeAdultSonx> Be like Joe Mande and write some bullshit how twitter used to be fun and you're better than us because you're deleting your account or whatever it was he said

[1:05:31] <glockaspaniel> the crucible
[1:05:32] <dmchandler> Civ 6 is free via the Epic store
[1:05:35] <Timb0nic> awww
[1:05:37] <dmchandler> if anyone likes those
[1:05:37] <beef__woman> it tends to be a verrrrry sudden onset
[1:05:39] <EpochError> like the play
[1:05:40] <sharkbutt> Patrick Ewing has the Roni I assume this has been discussed
[1:05:48] <Timb0nic> Monster Train is a card game?!
[1:05:49] <Cornetto_32> I'm so excited
[1:05:49] <farthammer1> Hey if you are gonna play Crucible...maybe play Cheeto Christ
[1:05:52] <mukau> oh this game looks like battleborn another failed game
[1:05:53] <Cornetto_32> what game is it...
[1:05:57] <buttdog69> @beef__woman jesus. i work at a grocery store so i'm just expecting that to happen any day now
[1:05:57] <plsbnicetome> monster train is good
[1:05:58] <dmchandler> niiice
[1:05:59] <joe_biden_official_> love the Civ games
[1:05:59] <party_bread> I cant wait for this sponsored content
[1:05:59] <nasty_nasty_nasty> oh my god yes
[1:06:00] <MarsIsWaiting> Civ is so good
[1:06:01] <thiccflair> civ VI rocks
[1:06:04] <trystypants> they're a blast
[1:06:04] <Mangoblin> hes gonna hate that
[1:06:05] <JonesMcPwnz> playing Civ 6? so another 24 hour stream then....
[1:06:05] <ridelysconch> monster train from blacked.com
[1:06:06] <arcademattchristman> oh shit
[1:06:10] <arcademattchristman> civ vi rule
[1:06:13] <dmchandler> i've only played the 5th and maybe the first, but they're fun
[1:06:15] <buttdog69> AOE2 rocks
[1:06:15] <thiccflair> ive been streaming civ 6 on and off for almost a year
[1:06:16] <thurstonfalco> love aoe2
[1:06:19] <Timb0nic> AoE 2 is still best game ever
[1:06:19] <arcademattchristman> Jesse will hate civ vi
[1:06:20] <nasty_nasty_nasty> i tried streaming civ once and it was very hard
[1:06:20] <bjork_liker> Civ is boring
[1:06:22] <dmchandler> its age of empires-y i'd say, as a genre
[1:06:23] <GFunkDeluxe> GFunkDeluxe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 22 month streak! Jesse please do the VR dance thing to family guide clips again
[1:06:24] <riiickyrubio> what about the dumb hospital game you play
[1:06:24] <nasty_nasty_nasty> i played so bad
[1:06:25] <joe_biden_official_> damn now I want to play Civ 6
[1:06:26] <thurstonfalco> civ is turn based
[1:06:26] <DruidUncle> rts vs turn based
[1:06:28] <beef__woman> @buttdog69 its good to be cautious, but don't live in fear. if it happens it happens but most people are just fine with it. so you'll be ok
[1:06:28] <trystypants> civ is like a board game
[1:06:29] <Dealeylama> They’re completely different games
[1:06:30] <chrome_chomsky> aoe2 is real time, civ is turn based
[1:06:31] <dipshed> i use to think they were similar because they are historical
[1:06:34] <hi_im_doug> i like civ, but dunno if thats a jesse game
[1:06:34] <rixgerald> it's like a board game kinda
[1:06:40] <Ohboymb> it's turd-based, like stefan's diet
[1:06:41] <sharkbutt> civ is fun make decisions via the chat
[1:06:43] <party_bread> its different jessie, sit down
[1:06:45] <joeveralls> AOE2 is a RTS
[1:06:47] <steveearlesweatshirt> i tried to play hearts of iron earlier but im too dumb
[1:06:54] <beef__woman> omg yes
[1:06:56] <party_bread> on purpose
[1:06:56] <buttdog69> @beef__woman thanks trying to take it a day at a time
[1:06:57] <Sogetastic> you can NOT build a jaeger in civ 6
[1:06:59] <ourfriendZin> heheheheheh - peter griffin
[1:07:00] <joeveralls> CIV6 is turn based strategy
[1:07:04] <beef__woman> @buttdog69 <3 <3 <3

[1:07:18] <party_bread> i have two different jesse/jessie streamers. im sorry
[1:07:18] <thiccflair> @Sogetastic you can build a giant death robot, p close
[1:07:19] <Dealeylama> Technically every game is a strategy game
[1:07:23] <sawks> hmmmmmm
[1:07:24] <dmchandler> when i play Civ, I think to myself "this is age of empires-y" (for real) so i get what JF mean byt stefan seems technically right
[1:07:24] <joestalin78> how's everyone doing this evening
[1:07:26] <zany_antics> crucible....is this game about witches or whatever
[1:07:27] <EpochError> @GoOffKings jf are you gonna put up your half of the premium audio thats probably infuriating to listen to
[1:07:27] <gweeedo> arthur miller..smart
[1:07:32] <beef__woman> remember what chris said
[1:07:34] <hi_im_doug> you telling me jeff bezos made this game?
[1:07:35] <beef__woman> hahha
[1:07:38] <DruidUncle> we love amazon!
[1:07:38] <listenerdave> I was curious about this, perfect timing!
[1:07:39] <pcarroll47> Jesse does rts just fucking mean nothing to you
[1:07:44] <ourfriendZin> what happened to Monster Train?

[1:07:57] <rodzirvin> I ordered dinner and then fell asleep for 3 hours

[1:08:04] <dmchandler> so x-com isn't the same as civ 6
[1:08:06] <KaiSquared> i grilled some burgers tonight that were so fucking good. even the wife said they were good. wife burgers are the best burgers.

[1:08:21] <artdamage> i made pizza tonight... thick crust in a cast iron skillet, onion and pepperoni
[1:08:22] <panicwearehanginghere> The Japan king of the hill arch is the best

[1:26:07] <Nightbot> lol
[1:26:08] <farthammer1> My favorite Bruce Springsteen song is the one where someone is trying to escape a small town. Also the small town is trapping them and it's a dead end. I like the one where he works in a factory.
[1:26:08] <heavyjob> What air instrument do you play during the end of Thunder Road?
[1:26:09] <TaintEnthusiast> tunnel of love was his horny album
[1:26:09] <Ohboymb> i don't like springsteen but i'm on fire is good
[1:26:09] <rodzirvin> I only know the 2 Born songs
[1:26:09] <dmchandler> i like im on fire, but haven't listened to much

[1:26:26] <farthammer1> Springsteen fucking sucks come fight me.
[1:26:27] <bjork_liker> Because the Night
[1:26:29] <WretchedNerd> Weird Al polka-parodied Tunnel of Love
[1:26:31] <yeeeeeeboiiii> is Springsteen the one that has a dumb ass nickname like "the dude" or whatever ?
[1:26:32] <Reaperov> lol
[1:26:32] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:26:35] <dipshed> great joke
[1:26:38] <lil_pookie_c> x-mas songs by springsteen, best mix
[1:26:39] <mikewilm> thats like knowing the ghost of tom jode or something lol
[1:26:40] <emmatown_> THE BOSS
[1:26:40] <mukau> hes not the biggest guy in the world hes only 5'10
[1:26:40] <artdamage> Bruce Springsteen "Badlands Chugs"
[1:26:43] <tjborg> ugh
[1:26:47] <Martin_Atchet_> wasn't that on a big soundtrack
[1:26:47] <dmchandler> The Night Manager, bruce springsteen
[1:26:51] <helltran> bruce springsteen is cool
[1:26:52] <itsmikeo> springsteen a little too "dad" for me, but damn he has a lot of songs I love
[1:26:54] <farthammer1> Springsteen is NOT the biggest guy in the world that would be Robert Wadlow.
[1:26:54] <zany_antics> hmm he's stealing DB's nickname?? not cool
[1:26:54] <tjborg> #notmyboss
[1:26:56] <ridelysconch> thats a branson

[1:27:28] <guillotine4prez> John goodman
[1:27:30] <emmatown_> jf should do voices
[1:27:34] <chrome_chomsky> the guy from breaking bad, weasel?
[1:27:35] <artdamage> bruce hornsby > bruce springsting
[1:27:37] <dipshed> he looks like a character on Tripping The Rift
[1:27:42] <gweeedo> ron perlman
[1:27:42] <Timb0nic> I actually thought Koechner too
[1:27:48] <sawks> emma i agree
[1:27:49] <zany_antics> Koechner is perfect IMO
[1:27:49] <ridelysconch> Jesse voices a character in 90 Day Fiancee
[1:27:50] <dmchandler> the best part of the sony leaks to me were the data tracking stuff they did that shows that people don't like josh gad
[1:27:53] <sputnik111> theres a very funny movie on prime (at least in canada) about a kid finding himself and overcoming racism in 1980s working class England through bruce Springsteens music. its bizarre
[1:27:53] <dylanbyth> billy bush
[1:27:58] <dmchandler> his test audience stuff
[1:28:01] <McCainFlightSchool> i think barack obama should do the voice

[1:28:01] <chrome_chomsky> badger i meant. brandon mayhew
[1:28:03] <starkimified> did you just say you didn't see David Koechner as blue collar?

[1:28:34] <starkimified> I think one of his characters is a trucker
[1:28:34] <zany_antics> yeah dimaggio is good
[1:28:36] <ridelysconch> Stephen Root
[1:28:36] <dmchandler> he can do country guys
[1:28:43] <TheGreatCactusJac> Koechner is from like rural Missouri or some shit
[1:28:45] <Ohboymb> yeah he literally does a trucker character
[1:28:46] <Dealeylama> Koechner was in a comedy act where the other guy was literally named The Naked Trucker
[1:28:47] <starkimified> with gruber allen?
[1:28:49] <SoundAlerts> pbostrom played Scungus Suck (V2) for 150 Bits
[1:28:51] <boogercousins> DB should do it
[1:28:51] <bjork_liker> Mike Mitchell
[1:28:52] <Nightbot> WE LOVE DB!!!
[1:28:52] <hank_khill> Koechner was in Naked Trucker and T Bones
[1:28:53] <TaintEnthusiast> Koechner has rich southerner vibes. Car dealer, church trustee, etc.
[1:28:55] <depitts> dimaggio would be good but you have to have someone famous
[1:28:58] <dmchandler> koechner had some dipshit rural characters
[1:29:02] <hank_khill> T Bones
[1:29:09] <one_bad_hamburger> kingsThankyou

[1:29:55] <glockaspaniel> rig robble
[1:29:56] <RadishGiant> marine/comedian
[1:29:56] <MikeASchneider> rob riggle's mini golf tv show looks fucking corny as hell
[1:29:57] <jamberg> he's good in a limited role.
[1:29:59] <chrome_chomsky> riggleheads
[1:30:00] <bloviated> riggle is a marine
[1:30:03] <TheGreatCactusJac> Riggle was good in Stepbrothers
[1:30:03] <yeeeeeeboiiii> Did you know he was a marine? :)
[1:30:04] <jamberg> he's awful on the Sunday football show though
[1:30:04] <Down10_> Star of Hot Tub Time Machine 2
[1:30:04] <migrainethresher> personally i think the military is a great place to launch a comedy career!!
[1:30:05] <dipshed> what has rob riggle done other than be a troops surrogate at football games
[1:30:06] <artdamage> Rob Riggle is a key player in the minigolf show
[1:30:06] <itsmikeo> he's a nice guy in person but yeah he's pretty limited as a comedic talent
[1:30:07] <ridelysconch> i actually watched step brothers last night lol
[1:30:08] <bjork_liker> Mike Mitchell
[1:30:09] <dmchandler> he should star

[1:30:26] <dmchandler> john c reilly can be the tommy lee jones now
[1:30:27] <KaiSquared> ok seriously this isn't a battle royale game? i really thought it was
[1:30:29] <joestalin78> John C. Reilly has had a crazy career. worked with some of the best directors... Malick, PTA, Tim & Eric...
[1:30:29] <Reaperov> no damn clue what this game is or what's happening
[1:30:30] <Martin_Atchet_> JCR being hot
[1:30:33] <coldslaw69> John C Reilly as Will Smith

[1:32:57] <Down10_> Is she the one with all the surgery?
[1:32:57] <alpacinogruntingnoise> I mix up Men in Black and Little Nicky because of the dogs

[1:33:45] <Land_Phil> shes queer
[1:33:47] <starkimified> the Vat of Acid episode was very good
[1:33:48] <ANDYCHILIPARTY> the last 3 rick and morty episodes have been pretty funny
[1:33:53] <Dealeylama> The superbowl one year had the debut trailers for Men in Black and Fifth Element
[1:33:56] <Down10_> oh really? @Land_Phil
[1:34:07] <Ohboymb> 911 gag what's that, homer choking down the crab juice???? sorry about this comment
[1:34:08] <dmchandler> i should watch ricky morty, i only saw the first season and thought it was good
[1:34:08] <alpacinogruntingnoise> Cory Booker scored as many Rosario Dawsons as he did touchdowns for Stanford football
[1:34:09] <PretzelRocks> Now Playing: The Plan by Curious Quail -> https://prtzl.to/zJHokgknc0
[1:34:18] <dmchandler> but then everyone started hating on it and the fans of the show
[1:34:19] <artdamage> i like the part when J helps the alien give birth and gets covered in slime, and he gets back in the care and K is like 'anything about that seem strange to you'
[1:34:20] <Reaperov> lol
[1:34:20] <Nightbot> that's funny

[1:34:42] <steveearlesweatshirt> the elon musk one was bad
[1:34:45] <Ohboymb> that's right
[1:34:47] <Timb0nic> its an excellent premise for sure
[1:34:48] <McCainFlightSchool> im pickle reeee
[1:34:49] <ANDYCHILIPARTY> @dmchandler it's good, the third season is pretty hit or miss but recently it's been good
[1:34:50] <TheGreatCactusJac> Fandoms ruin everything
[1:34:53] <jamberg> my dad randomly started watching it and he's been texting being like "THIS IS SO FUNNY" and i'm like "oh you're so pure and offline"
[1:34:54] <pbostrom> that's right
[1:34:56] <boogercousins> Live in Newark everyone hates Corey booker here
[1:34:57] <Ohboymb> and the hosts as well
[1:35:00] <Down10_> Elon Musk has gotta go

[1:35:35] <dmchandler> elon musk being revered in star trek discovery is also embarrassing
[1:35:37] <RadishGiant> nightmare
[1:35:37] <GFunkDeluxe> kingsTREAT
[1:35:39] <Reaperov> Dadhole is a Top Gamer
[1:35:50] <sawks> this is a little monster hunter-ish no?
[1:35:53] <dmchandler> the marketing of elon musk as real life tony stark was so successful
[1:35:56] <dmchandler> it sucks so much
[1:35:56] <migrainethresher> who else was horny as a youth for linda fiorentino in men in black? anyone? c'mon!
[1:35:56] <DruidUncle> used to live a block away from that statue in Tulsa... feels bad
[1:35:57] <ExclamationMarx> is elon musk just a MRA now?

[1:36:20] <sawks> jesse said the n word at dinner
[1:36:20] <lipwipwipwip> is anyone watching that other roiland show

[1:37:51] <Ohboymb> switch is the first console i've ever gone all-digital
[1:37:52] <chillBuu> thats why i only have one cartridge and i always keep it in the switch
[1:37:54] <Down10_> JF is probably the greatest dad, which is how he's such a nut online
[1:37:54] <Ohboymb> and it rules
[1:37:55] <listenerdave> listenerdave subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! switch cartridges are coated in a bitterant to prevent ingestion
[1:37:58] <egoldfarb> I don’t let my kids handle the cartridges
[1:38:02] <spennyspennyspenny> thats psycho sahit i hate it
[1:38:03] <sawks> i never did that shit as a kid
[1:38:06] <jamberg> classic gamer move
[1:38:08] <artdamage> my kid jammed a cartridge into the switch backwards the other day ... i was terrified
[1:38:08] <Down10_> @listenerdave That's true!

[1:38:21] <nasty_nasty_nasty> the switch cards are so tiny, if i had a switch as a kid i would have lost every single one
[1:38:27] <listenerdave> @down10_ I had to try it
[1:38:28] <egoldfarb> I have a single small pelican case that holds all the cartridges
[1:38:35] <boogercousins> I’ve been playing Skate 3 for a psycho amount of hours the past two days
[1:38:37] <egoldfarb> Because otherwise they would all instantly be lost
[1:38:45] <dmlat> naked CDs sitting on top of the console is a lifestyle
[1:38:54] <dmchandler> i would've LOVED needing to miss school as a kid, no matter the cause
[1:38:55] <egoldfarb> (My older 2 kids are the ages of JF’s kids)
[1:38:55] <declaredyuppie> They probably just know not to ask you JF
[1:38:56] <zany_antics> you could say they've been training for it their whole lives
[1:38:57] <carpenter_groot> that describes me pretty well
[1:38:58] <Down10_> I think it's wild that we still have cartridge-based games in this decade

[1:41:55] <zany_antics> I used to be all about filth. now i'm more into not filth though
[1:42:02] <migrainethresher> it's cool to think about how many people probably worked unpaid overtime to make a game that will immediately be forgotten

[1:52:39] <migrainethresher> it's like a premium skin for your duvet
[1:52:41] <colonelfarva> its also difficult to wash a comforter but much easier to wash the cover
[1:52:43] <spennyspennyspenny> Later seasons have some hilarious premises, but seasons 2 and 3 have insane jokes-per-minute

[1:59:23] <jibjab_> 5 is underrated
[1:59:26] <chillBuu> the only gatorade you need is the one with the NIPPLE top
[1:59:26] <KaiSquared> lol
[1:59:26] <Nightbot> that's funny

[1:59:36] <mediumlizard> 9
[1:59:36] <lil_pookie_c> which corner store sells fierce strawberry?
[1:59:36] <hectordoink> 5 is not good
[1:59:37] <Land_Phil> i dont think ive ever had catcus cooler which is weird because ive lived in the southwest a good part of my life
[1:59:38] <artdamage> green apple has no place in gatorade
[1:59:39] <nasty_nasty_nasty> strawberry drinks can be good
[1:59:43] <copsareharam> lime cucumber seems psycho
[1:59:44] <bloviated> strawberry milk is low key nice though
[1:59:45] <homerundarby> strawberries aren't even pink
[1:59:48] <themattymac> 9 has to go to hell
[1:59:54] <pbostrom> 2, 11, 4
[1:59:58] <Land_Phil> i think orange is the worst one of the bunch
[2:00:00] <zany_antics> green apple shit always sucks
[2:00:01] <bluestraveler666> this is exactly why we watch go off kings

[2:00:12] <europeansheep> green apple drinks are poopoo
[2:00:13] <LaOwlLOL> berry something
[2:00:16] <uoenodoe> riptide rush is the greatest of that line
[2:00:16] <artdamage> man ive got little gatorades in my fridge im gonna fuckin rip one right this second
[2:00:16] <howintensive> GET GREEN APPLE OUT OF HERE
[2:00:17] <hectordoink> lime cucumber actually rocked when i tried it
[2:00:17] <WheezTheSnus> fierce strawberry is mike mitchell's favorite flavor
[2:00:19] <twotontesticle> Get green apple out of here
[2:00:20] <copsareharam> also not on this list that's a psycho flavor: limon pepino
[2:00:20] <IIIRemy> is the fierce green apple a sleeper hit underdog?
[2:00:23] <howintensive> Green Apple sucks
[2:00:28] <sawks> i would not like that
[2:00:30] <howintensive> awful flavor
[2:00:34] <themattymac> I can feel it on my teeth
[2:00:34] <pbostrom> citrus cooler was the Jordan branded flavor
[2:00:35] <Cornetto_32> ok but what would be hank hills choices
[2:00:36] <TaintEnthusiast> methinks some gold for thee, for you have won the internets!!!

[2:00:47] <Land_Phil> @farthammer1 https://youtu.be/s7m7B1YrYA0
[2:00:48] <jrvilla26> WTF is glacier cherry. That sounds great
[2:00:49] <dumassolay> worst one is lime cucumber by a mile
[2:00:51] <migrainethresher> glacier freeze tastes like pixie sticks
[2:00:52] <andclavin> cucumber doesn't belong in gatorade
[2:00:55] <migrainethresher> and it rules
[2:00:56] <mukau> banana?
[2:00:56] <hectordoink> green apple was just ok
[2:00:56] <bloviated> banana
[2:00:58] <yeeeeeeboiiii> no

[2:01:02] <jamberg> banana
[2:01:03] <chillBuu> banana laffy taffies are bomb

[2:01:03] <dunkaccino> cough drops
[2:01:05] <munt69> orange
[2:01:06] <lipwipwipwip> buck
[2:01:07] <Land_Phil> glacier cherry rocks my socks

[2:01:13] <copsareharam> i've always liked white cherry
[2:01:13] <The_Wizard_Adam> i have a "melon" scented hand soap that smells so fucking bad

[2:01:19] <dunkaccino> cherry cough drops no thanks
[2:01:19] <pcarroll47> Grape
[2:01:21] <steevnpairu> my first hookup had a real bad cherry
[2:01:21] <jamberg> grape can be bad in the wrong hands
[2:01:21] <themattymac> banana
[2:01:22] <MikeASchneider> all cherry tastes like medicine to me
[2:01:23] <bloviated> artificial coconut isn't great
[2:01:24] <zednaught> you still need to get a gros michel
[2:01:24] <scubadoo2188> strawberry starburst are the best
[2:01:24] <Land_Phil> also, the best bubly flavor is cherry
[2:01:25] <depitts> lemon can go wrong
[2:01:27] <dmlat> the streets demand a Tamarind Gatorade
[2:01:27] <pcarroll47> Orange can go SO bad
[2:01:28] <one_bad_hamburger> dark cherry soda no good
[2:01:30] <C00LlN> artificial strawberry kicks ass, i love the strawberry hard candies with the chewy inside
[2:01:30] <bluestraveler666> you know whats the best candy? banana laffy taffy
[2:01:30] <twotontesticle> One looks like piss
[2:01:31] <listenerdave> runt flavors keep 3

[2:01:34] <farthammer1> @Land_Phil Krusty was wrong!!!
[2:01:34] <love_too_watch_games> children's cold medicine is the worst cherry
[2:01:38] <usernamehaver> uhhh
[2:01:40] <WheezTheSnus> i have glacier freeze powder that I mix with creatine hcl making a sour gatorade. pretty good
[2:01:41] <dmlat> grape is also a medicine-tainted flavor
[2:01:41] <braddawson> banana medicine rocked
[2:01:45] <chrome_chomsky> loved the banana medicine
[2:01:46] <pcarroll47> Like a horrible medicine orange is evil to me
[2:01:46] <dunkaccino> isnt bubblegum flavoring just banana?
[2:01:49] <MikeASchneider> never had a banana medicine. the bubble gum earache medicine is famous though
[2:01:50] <bloviated> coconut flavor misses why coconut is fun to eat

[2:02:50] <xannyboy420> great artificial flavor - runts banana
[2:02:52] <bobricebobrice> and runts
[2:02:53] <listenerdave> are there Runts in Canada?
[2:02:53] <twotontesticle> I think the wrapper alone made me never eat one
[2:02:55] <munt69> mango
[2:02:57] <LaOwlLOL> watermelon is always top tier
[2:02:57] <dmlat> love a generic 'berry' flavor
[2:02:58] <listenerdave> huge setup there
[2:02:58] <andclavin> watermelon is not a safe bet. orange is a safe bet
[2:02:59] <pecotaredux> blue raspberry is a good call, lemon is usually legit
[2:02:59] <Land_Phil> mango
[2:03:00] <Dealeylama> Watermelon best Airhead
[2:03:00] <europeansheep> peach iced tea oh baby those are great

[2:04:13] <jelqmeister> what flavor is that supposed to be?
[2:04:14] <AfroGunsou> i had that sweet lightning and its really good
[2:04:16] <xannyboy420> looks good
[2:04:17] <artdamage> that shit is nowhere near as good as Baja
[2:04:19] <rodzirvin> Sweet tea?
[2:04:19] <twotontesticle> A peach Nehi float is good
[2:04:19] <lil_pookie_c> damn, baja blast is so good
[2:04:19] <bluestraveler666> bluestraveler666 gifted a Tier 1 sub to laffytaffygaddafi! They have given 113 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:04:21] <MikeASchneider> it's peach
[2:04:22] <copsareharam> it's like orange
[2:04:23] <zany_antics> looks like the piss of someone very dehydrated
[2:04:23] <europeansheep> sweet tea
[2:04:23] <my_bussy_hurty> that's fucked
[2:04:24] <artdamage> its peach flavored
[2:04:24] <pecotaredux> Twin Snakes are the top haribo candy, maybe the cola bottles
[2:04:24] <jelqmeister> the mountain dew Zero is amazing
[2:04:35] <itsmikeo> do they still make Sangrita Blast???
[2:04:38] <itsmikeo> love that stuff
[2:04:38] <IIIRemy> looks to be fried chicken flavor

[2:04:42] <jelqmeister> @pecotaredux i get the starmix
[2:04:46] <chillBuu> i want that violet mountain dew from japan
[2:04:48] <bluestraveler666> baja blast is great as a mixer if you are 20 years old and poor
[2:04:48] <WheezTheSnus> sweet lightning is no baja blast
[2:04:50] <jakemasterflex> The Cucumber one is not super bad
[2:04:51] <McCainFlightSchool> popeyes is so much better
[2:04:52] <howintensive> Mountain Dew White Out is pretty good
[2:04:54] <artdamage> dont eat the bones
[2:05:05] <pecotaredux> @jelqmeister best variety option for sure
[2:05:05] <sawks> i used to love the midnight black or whatever that was
[2:05:09] <dumassolay> its just sweet
[2:05:09] <chillBuu> https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pXYTcqfCL._SL1000_.jpg
[2:05:15] <artdamage> Code Red
[2:05:16] <pecotaredux> pitch black to whiteout
[2:05:16] <jelqmeister> voltage is great
[2:05:18] <artdamage> cherry
[2:05:20] <considerthetetrapod> code red is the only soda i ever liked
[2:05:21] <Land_Phil> @chillBuu good lord
[2:05:22] <C00LlN> oh its great, i tried it when they had the cheetos chicken sandwich last year
[2:05:22] <howintensive> it's grenadine
[2:05:22] <bluestraveler666> code red is red
[2:05:23] <dumassolay> code red is like red pop
[2:05:24] <jakemasterflex> You tried Mountain Dew Zero?
[2:05:24] <sawks> best mountain dew is live wire don't @ me
[2:05:25] <zany_antics> they used to have a kinda sour mountain dew that was awesome
[2:05:26] <Reaperov> cherry and like lime
[2:05:26] <depitts> its red flavor
[2:05:29] <Land_Phil> cobra or code red
[2:05:29] <zany_antics> YES
[2:05:30] <gweeedo> more like a mountain dont
[2:05:31] <mukau> stefan calls himself a gamer and doesnt know every mountain dew flavor?
[2:05:31] <farthammer1> Discover a flavor as real as the streets: Mountain Dew Code Red
[2:05:32] <RadishGiant> Mountains dew
[2:05:33] <artdamage> Live Wire is orange
[2:05:34] <zany_antics> the sour one was so good
[2:05:35] <howintensive> WHITE OUT
[2:05:37] <dumassolay> red pop isn't cherry it's red pop
[2:05:42] <skungus> pitch black. 2
[2:05:43] <pecotaredux> Dew Fast Dew Furious
[2:05:44] <WheezTheSnus> they have baja blast zero sugar at wal mart now
[2:05:50] <C00LlN> Mountain Dew LiveWire is awesome
[2:05:53] <chillBuu> they named the grape flavor of mountain dew in the US mountain dew PITCH BLACK
[2:05:58] <jakemasterflex> Mt Dew Zero
[2:05:58] <oklazydog> one of the ingredients in regular mountain dew is concentrated orange juice
[2:06:00] <jelqmeister> waiting for code red/voltage zero sugar
[2:06:00] <puzzlemustard> i did used to work at pepsico and this is mostly right
[2:06:02] <howintensive> baja blast zero is good
[2:06:05] <themattymac> Coke Zero is a prequel
[2:06:05] <C00LlN> also the newer blue one is great
[2:06:07] <itsmikeo> damn looks like taco bell doesn't sell Sangrita Blast Mtn Dew anymore...miss that stuff
[2:06:07] <depitts> would i get it if i didn't drink the first one?
[2:06:14] <C00LlN> voltage?
[2:06:18] <zany_antics> did anyone try the cinnamon coke when that was out? surprisingly good
[2:06:19] <pecotaredux> I wish I didn't love high fructose corn syrup so much

[2:06:37] <one_bad_hamburger> vanilla coke is good

[2:06:43] <one_bad_hamburger> no orange
[2:06:45] <rodzirvin> I wanna stop drinking soda but I cant give up Sprite
[2:06:45] <lil_pookie_c> Blue Sky cherry vanilla
[2:06:50] <itsmikeo> no one else remembers Sangrita Blast??
[2:06:57] <pecotaredux> once I went like three weeks without having a soda and I picked up a can of vanilla coke at a corner store and drinking it felt like time slowed down and Desert Rose was playing as wind blew through my hair
[2:07:00] <artdamage> Dollar General was supposed to get a new exclusive Mt Dew flavor... i looked around for it right before lockdown but never found it
[2:07:00] <chillBuu> REED'S GINGER ALE
[2:07:00] <howintensive> sangrita blast was ok
[2:07:01] <coolermaster88> ginger ale is the perfect airplane drink
[2:07:01] <Land_Phil> i havent had a soda in year
[2:07:11] <Land_Phil> @pecotaredux lol
[2:07:12] <jakemasterflex> @AfroGunsou I'd rather just have like A&W Cream sode because thats the thing they make, idk just strange to me
[2:07:14] <one_bad_hamburger> cactus cooler in a can = best

[2:07:28] <one_bad_hamburger> out of a soda machine on break preferrably
[2:07:31] <lil_pookie_c> Blue Sky cream soda is very good
[2:07:34] <Land_Phil> jameson and ginger ale kicks ass
[2:07:36] <itsmikeo> yeah i think they discontinued it...it was great, like a Jamaica mixed with Dew
[2:07:38] <Land_Phil> havent had one in ages
[2:07:49] <dreww> this game seems terrible
[2:07:55] <bloviated> once you cut out soda you realize how few other satisfying drinks there are besides water
[2:08:00] <TheBigAristotle69420> hi kings
[2:08:01] <pecotaredux> Have you guys had Ting? I think it's a Jamaican thing but the corner stores near me have it
[2:08:03] <pecotaredux> good shit
[2:08:05] <artdamage> "Dollar General and MTN DEW announce MTN DEW® Maui Burst as a permanent, exclusive offering"
[2:08:07] <C00LlN> my first trip to the store in months they didnt have the full sugar mountain dew in 24 packs so i just didnt buy any

[2:08:42] <artdamage> F R E S C A
[2:08:43] <AfroGunsou> i dont drink a lot of soda but i could absolutely never cut it out completely. sometiems you just HAVE to have a soda
[2:08:45] <depitts> i had a jamaican peanut soda once. it was nasty
[2:08:50] <pcarroll47> A place that does Grubhub around here offers it
[2:08:50] <notsobadandyou> Ting is amazing

[2:09:07] <one_bad_hamburger> that sounds good
[2:09:07] <farthammer1> Peen Nut soda
[2:09:11] <howintensive> peen nut soda
[2:09:12] <Dealeylama> Aloe vera soda is not bad
[2:09:14] <pcarroll47> But worth a try imo
[2:09:14] <jrvilla26> Milk
