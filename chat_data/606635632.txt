The mods say I was banned by the automoderator and they will unban me if send them a picture of myself verifying that I am the comic in the picture I posted. I'm looking through KatWillFerrel tweets for a picture to send them. Any suggestions?

[0:50:16] <Down10_> Every time I hear about YouTubers making millions of dollars and being more popular than most celebrities, it makes me depressed.
[0:50:16] <artdamage> runnin on empty food reviews
[0:50:18] <SocialistWaluigi> theres no way he's not commit massive tax fraud
[0:50:19] <yarightdude> can you imagine joey doing taxes lol
[0:50:23] <AfroGunsou> i like teh baconator
[0:50:27] <SocialistWaluigi> *committing
[0:50:28] <naffologist> his taxes are done on a baconator wrapper
[0:50:32] <MarsIsWaiting> i bet joey makes like $21,000
[0:50:33] <dmlat> i'd guess 60-80k before taxes
[0:50:33] <TheGreatCactusJac> Joey doesn't make enough from youtube to cover his medical premiums
[0:50:35] <sawks> what is his day job
[0:50:36] <Ohboymb> joey makes america takes
[0:50:37] <Smanchburger> I saw that Yu Darvish made over $50,000 on YT just this offseason but donates it all to charity
[0:50:40] <cosmocat69> Are there people watching Joey unironically? I want to meet these people
[0:50:40] <headlesspresident> Joey's entire YouTube meals are write offs

[0:50:55] <SocialistWaluigi> which is funny bc libertarians are incredibly stupid
[0:50:57] <rodzirvin> I think he clears 100
[0:50:58] <SeriousAdult> joey makes the bewbewbewbew sound when he's doin math in his head
[0:50:58] <105iq> i would say 75k
[0:50:59] <toilet_noise> if i was to guess I'd say joey is the third richest man in america
[0:51:00] <cn_monoxide> I think Joey makes 110k year after taxes
[0:51:01] <sawks> lmao
[0:51:05] <heycorvidae> seat warmer
[0:51:08] <big__soda> thats so fucking depressing
[0:51:11] <maxbme> Joey is a millionaire to me
[0:51:14] <Down10_> I don't think there are any genuinely smart conservative. Only dummies and grifters
[0:51:17] <TaintEnthusiast> I would buy any car from joey at any price, any type of predatory financing
[0:51:19] <farthammer1> Joey posted on Insta that he makes $13,000/year
[0:51:20] <Timb0nic> driving the cars to do food reviews
[0:51:24] <scubadoo2188> someone go buy a car from Joey
[0:51:26] <AfroGunsou> hearing about how much youtubers make makes me really sad and angry
[0:51:29] <bloviated> imagine working in Joey's office
[0:51:32] <markovblanket> if I went to buy a car and joey was in there I'd lose my shit
[0:51:33] <theoverluk> anyone that buttons the polo shirt to the chin is a rich libertarian
[0:51:40] <SeriousAdult> where does joey live?
[0:51:41] <notkaz> they inflate Joey up and his arms wave around in the parking lot
[0:51:49] <ARealLifeBear> imagine buying a car from Joey while he's doing the voices and woop woops
[0:51:53] <spinneylong> @theoverluk or they are british
[0:51:53] <dumbash> @theoverluk what about ironically
[0:51:53] <LilStinker> I sat next to Kobayashi on the train one time
[0:52:00] <uhh_nik> google says about $3-$5 per 1000 video views for youtube
[0:52:11] <theoverluk> Is Joey british?
[0:52:13] <sawks> depends on ads too
[0:52:17] <Timb0nic> What about all the money that McDonalds, Burger King, Wendys and KFC pay to Joey??
[0:52:39] <DaneKnight> donald trump gifted me 1200 dollars
[0:52:41] <Ohboymb> don't forget to subtract the food costs
[0:52:44] <durkuniverse> youtube pays in minutes watched
[0:52:46] <heycorvidae> @LilStinker did he eat your wiener?
[0:52:47] <AfroGunsou> @GoOffKings imagine joey doing a sovereign citizen video in character
[0:52:47] <spinneylong> @theoverluk no im saying british people also button the polo up to the top alot
[0:52:50] <MarsIsWaiting> @GoOffKings here's what he makes according to his statistics https://us.youtubers.me/joeysworldtour/youtube-estimated-earnings
[0:52:52] <Lickface76> lmao
[0:52:52] <M_Go_Dead> we should get that spencer guy to harrass joey about it like he did with the doughboys
[0:52:52] <Nightbot> lol
[0:52:57] <slow_biden> so 160 bucks/video
[0:53:02] <chrome_chomsky> 200 a video then
[0:53:12] <sawks> @AfroGunsou weweweweweoooooo i'm just a traveler
[0:53:12] <SeriousAdult> wait how many videos does he make a week?
[0:53:21] <andyateacrayon> he lives in squalor
[0:53:24] <chrome_chomsky> but a few making thousands
[0:53:25] <slow_biden> damn, I went midpoint on 3-5 per 1k
[0:53:25] <SeriousAdult> it depends how frequently he makes videos
[0:53:26] <dumbash> Holy fuck lol
[0:53:34] <Lickface76> he does it for the love of the game not money
[0:53:36] <Down10_> !buddysystem
[0:53:37] <GooseDerricksoN> I'
[0:53:37] <Nightbot> Down10_ 's Emergency Evacuation Buddy is cn_monoxide
[0:53:37] <Chexoid> it has a little cartoon moth flying out of a wallet
[0:53:37] <notkaz> damn a billion people go on YouTube a day... if I could get 1% of that I would make 4 million dollars a video...
[0:53:37] <pactrict> lost money in march of 2019?
[0:53:45] <tuffghost> march 2019: $-519
[0:53:46] <GooseDerricksoN> I'd take an extra $600 a month
[0:53:47] <durkuniverse> that sounds about right. youtube is no longer a platform to make big money like a few years ago
[0:53:48] <Mangoblin> love of the game baby
[0:53:48] <EpochError> just considered that a guy who just goes to wendys and mcdonalds called his channel joeys world tour
[0:53:48] <theoverluk> @spinneylong standby I'm gonna bing image search that. its a great look
[0:53:49] <SeriousAdult> he def would still do it
[0:53:51] <Down10_> ugh
[0:53:54] <slow_biden> just down-payment for his quadruple bypass
[0:53:55] <twotontesticle> Ya pure love fersure
[0:53:57] <andyateacrayon> what is peep this out's actual job?
[0:53:58] <spinneylong> yea idk 700 bucks a month is not nothing
[0:53:58] <Timb0nic> YouTube fuck over their creators thats why he pushes Cameo so hard
[0:54:05] <usernamehaver> that site shows that one month he lost money
[0:54:06] <cosmocat69> Does Joey have patreon
[0:54:07] <pactrict> cant put a price on influence
[0:54:10] <spinneylong> 700 bucks a month to eat shit and talk? why not
[0:54:12] <GooseDerricksoN> Sponsorships are where Youtubers make money
[0:54:14] <MyHeroZer0> i only had 25k subscribers and was getting $400 per month
[0:54:24] <chrome_chomsky> yeah most of his estimated earnings are between $600 and $2000
[0:54:28] <Nightbot> Subscribe to the hit Podcast, Your Kickstarter Sucks hosted by our very own JF and DB at https://bit.ly/2IZreVO and get bonus episodes at https://www.patreon.com/yourkickstartersucks!
[0:54:30] <usernamehaver> March 2019 it says he made - $519
[0:54:33] <durkuniverse> just about a ton of the youtube channels i watched this year has released an "i'm frustrated with youtube" video
[0:54:41] <chrome_chomsky> per month
[0:54:42] <toilet_noise> you need to subtract what would have to be huge medical expenses
[0:54:44] <LilacWhimski> stefan showing up in a peep this out shirt on stream would be pretty good
[0:54:44] <AfroGunsou> but its view count not subscribers rigt?
[0:54:45] <SeriousAdult> he gets weak views for 500k subs
[0:54:50] <slow_biden> can't wait for Joey's pyramid scheme (not sure of he'll be a leader or follower)
[0:54:55] <rodzirvin> He's probably making 1000 a month
[0:55:04] <considerthetetrapod> this conversation would piss Chris off so bad
[0:55:05] <Down10_> Doesn't *every* channel post a video complaining about YouTube?
[0:55:10] <uoenodoe> scr*ne
[0:55:11] <dmlat> god imagine what joeys health insurance costs are
[0:55:15] <Down10_> But they never leave
[0:55:16] <hrkac> ask to see his tax return on cameo

[0:55:18] <dmlat> thats terrifying
[0:55:22] <slow_biden> woo woo woo, 15000 cardiologist bill. WOO WOO
[0:55:22] <spinneylong> $1000 a month isnt bad for a side business to be honest, hes gotta eat anyway right?
[0:55:29] <Reaperov> how much do you make JF?
[0:55:29] <spaghettikong> @eponeen Thanks for the gift sub!!!
