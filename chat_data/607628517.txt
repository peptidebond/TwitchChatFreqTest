[1:02:54] <farthammer1> E CHECK
[1:02:54] <GoOffKings> @pizza_suplex damn
[1:02:55] <adullahan> NEAS helped me out on a really bad day, gave me a lot of laughter and joy
[1:02:59] <heycorvidae> very unwell
[1:03:00] <dreww> a @GoOffKings stream with a game not downloaded to jesse's ps4 yet? wild
[1:03:00] <munt69> fucked up lady
[1:03:01] <zany_antics> she's quite "mentally ill"
[1:03:08] <mikelenehan> i also muted her
[1:03:10] <quigleyoto> We all about to listen to Drake?
[1:03:12] <farthammer1> Jesse said E Check and so I made that...ah fuck it
[1:03:13] <RadishGiant> yup
[1:03:17] <DoogieHowserSpankedMySon> the JJ supercut helped mellow me out at night and provide some laughs before bed
[1:03:17] <SoundAlerts> migrainethresher played Chris Toilet for 10 Bits
[1:03:18] <GoOffKings> @dreww i fucked up....
[1:03:18] <mayoH20> @noprankradio i'm slowly working my way from the start on NEAS and cherishing every moment
[1:03:18] <very____cool> I think I straight blocked
[1:03:22] <SwoopaLoop00> chris is right in my professional opinion
[1:03:22] <cosmocat69> Her real name is Jennifer Hamm and she changed it to Xeni Jardin
[1:03:25] <umjammer_danny> I'm just gonna ask her for money until she blocks me
[1:03:25] <GoOffKings> @DoogieHowserSpankedMySon best vid around
[1:03:27] <eboe> chris' content is a great pick me up and one of the few things i still watch on youtube
[1:03:28] <uoenodoe> lol
[1:03:36] <RadishGiant> me
[1:03:37] <bloviated> Xeni is short for Xeniflores
[1:03:37] <mooosefrog> she's on tv and shit. it sucks
[1:03:57] <hurlcat> yeah go after the saddest, loneliest ones
[1:03:58] <farthammer1> I said E Check in reference to Jenny Hamm but also in reference to Jesse getting an E Check
[1:03:59] <EpochError> he has 150k followers and gets almost no engagements on her posts. maybe everyone has her muted
[1:03:59] <copsareharam> Xeni is short for xanax
[1:04:00] <quigleyoto> fuck im destroyed
[1:04:02] <BoraxPoindexter> her head looks like the aliens from This Island Earth
[1:04:02] <comradeAustin> xeni is grifting. the ones supporting her in the replies are the real freaks
[1:04:07] <SwoopaLoop00> most of them are in the chat
[1:04:07] <friggindummy> the people who are legitimately weird are good
[1:04:09] <AfroGunsou> jesse just say my name okay.
[1:04:10] <andyateacrayon> I am not JFs enemy
[1:04:16] <chrome_chomsky> her real name was Jennifer White Owl Jaguar Hamm (actually) https://twitter.com/chomsky_chrome/status/1255986503899103232
[1:04:26] <farthammer1> Fewest enemies
[1:04:29] <TaintEnthusiast> "fewest" is grammatically correct
[1:04:41] <quigleyoto> I only turned on them that one time
[1:04:44] <markovblanket> you gotta clap their cheeks
[1:04:47] <EpochError> jf stirred up the musk hive recently
[1:04:51] <MarsIsWaiting> JF's mentions are full of people auditioning their bits. it sucks
[1:04:54] <farthammer1> Taint gets it
[1:04:57] <markovblanket> clap the other cheek
[1:04:57] <friggindummy> or for them to tweet out that they are taking a break
[1:05:08] <nasty_nasty_nasty> i deleted twitter two months ago and feel much happier since
[1:05:10] <SwoopaLoop00> chris is right, again
[1:05:10] <PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Silver by Panorama -> https://prtzl.to/WBHdV2EgHy
[1:05:12] <copsareharam> she definitely picked up that name when working for the travel agency @chrome_chomsky
[1:05:13] <nasty_nasty_nasty> but it's impossible to get news without twitter
[1:05:13] <McCainFlightSchool> twitter is a lot like therapy though
[1:05:14] <AfroGunsou> @marsiswaiting no I'm not
[1:05:16] <munt69> I got banned 2 months ago and it's been great
