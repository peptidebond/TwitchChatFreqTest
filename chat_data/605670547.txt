[0:06:55] <Nightbot> I bought a bundt cake for Jesse about a month ago. When I brought it home, he got irritated because he has been trying to eat healthier. So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today.

[0:27:57] <JoeBushDotNet> you can get wood from trees
[0:27:59] <smallanis> which takes a while
[0:28:03] <jamberg> i know bc i went to other islands before i built the store

[0:28:08] <europeansheep> how much for a pup lick
[0:28:12] <dadsbody> You can buy one at the atm with nook miles
[0:28:15] <oldnick42> Go to the ATM in the resident office first.
[0:28:16] <bizzylarge> you can go to other islands before that they just need to buy a ticket at the little terminal

[0:28:31] <jomnysins> once you pay off first mortgage
[0:28:31] <oldnick42> Nook miles at the ATM, get a ticket, then go to the airport.
[0:28:32] <LilacWhimski> they might need a nook miles ticket first
[0:28:35] <dadsbody> Buy a nook miles ticket at the ATM
[0:28:37] <Cornetto_32> @gooffkings also if you build a campsite people will come by periodically and you can get them to stay

[1:22:38] <buttbuttpeeman> @gooffkings sorry for the barrage, this game isn't easy. It looks like you changed to "Button" pitching not "Pulse". Button randomizes the pitch around where you throw it based on players stats. Pulse does too but to a lesser extent, and better timing by you can improve the pitch quality.

[1:42:03] <oldnick42> @farthammer1 I've listened to the commentary, any theory is just supported by the movie accidentally. It's ambiguous on the screen, which is great.

[1:57:38] <carpenter_groot> probably should not attempt to run the pc at all, the components can suffer serious damage if the psu is bad
[1:57:49] <cosmocat69> Jessie I fell asleep mid stream and the hell noises gave me nightmares
[1:57:55] <Ohboymb> nice chris

[1:58:06] <migrainethresher> call in the geek squad
[1:58:11] <Chexoid> is there some way we can help by saying scrone
[1:58:11] <McBigDingus> sounds like an overheating issue
[1:58:19] <ANDYCHILIPARTY> stefan i'd pick it up, too, if i could
[1:58:20] <braddawson> if only we knew someone who was into tech
[1:58:21] <goodfriendjake> chris fuckin rules. great guy
[1:58:24] <Cornetto_32> haha stefan avoiding the answer of the price
[1:58:25] <oldnick42> Stefan you can determine if it's the power supply by using a paperclip.
[1:58:27] <listenerdave> can probably diagnose it without bringing it in!
[1:58:29] <Scud0> power supply sounds like a good bet
[1:58:29] <Lickface76> lol
[1:58:29] <zany_antics> lmfao
[1:58:29] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:58:32] <Land_Phil> lol
[1:58:32] <TaintEnthusiast> quarter million, easily
[1:58:33] <jibjab_> 60 bucks
[1:58:34] <listenerdave> bc you'd have to really scrub that rig
[1:58:34] <usernamehaver> lol
[1:58:39] <AfroGunsou> $2500 canadian
[1:58:43] <oldnick42> Google it. You just need to connect a paperclip to your PSU and just run the PSU alone for a while, and see if it turns off.
[1:58:45] <migrainethresher> almost looks like a normal rig
[1:58:45] <carpenter_groot> whats the power supply
[1:58:45] <ANDYCHILIPARTY> a couple dollars
[1:58:51] <oldnick42> If it doesn't, it's another part, not the PSU.
[1:58:51] <acoolguyishere> acoolguyishere subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! did i miss the gremio roast
[1:58:51] <McCainFlightSchool> stefan spent 42,069 on it
[1:58:54] <skungus> got that go off kings money
[1:58:56] <zany_antics> I would rather name celerys
[1:59:01] <selfies420> do they have the greek squad in canada?
[1:59:06] <oldnick42> It's very easy and not dangerous Stefan. Use the paperclip.
[1:59:07] <listenerdave> paperclip test absolutely works to test PSU @oldnick42
[1:59:16] <farthammer1> Stefan put a penny in it
[1:59:24] <oldnick42> I've done it multiple times at Newegg HQ Stefan.
[1:59:31] <pbostrom> my rig started acting funny because the fan was unplugged and it kept overheating and shutting down
[1:59:33] <listenerdave> royal tennis
[1:59:40] <chrome_chomsky> give the psu a little lick, to test it
[1:59:48] <jibjab_> can you beat up the other team in this game. add some excitement for ol' jim and chris

[2:00:05] <braddawson> its cold in there too
[2:00:07] <owlyoop> wear socks and rub your feet along the carpet and then touch your motherboard to test it
[2:00:11] <McCainFlightSchool> stefan have you tried unplugging your computer and plugging it back in
[2:00:13] <burls> is stefan talking thru a tin can?
[2:00:16] <lil_pookie_c> Chris got grumpy
[2:00:18] <burls> just got here
[2:00:20] <chillBuu> he has to look so close bc it's not in quibiblio mode

[2:00:21] <ChrisSaidHEEP> getting ready to say the thing again
[2:00:26] <migrainethresher> looks like the problem here is stefan's computer is full of cum
