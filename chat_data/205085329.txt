[0:17:11] <Clifftaurus> Stefan, Jesse called you an anti-canadian slur.
[0:17:12] <jmccee> "why cant you hear me bitch, you need to fix your shit" - jesse

[0:20:32] <prof_hardcastle> boy those venus delivery boys are quick!
[0:20:33] <papahunkk> stay in that tower the whole game and wait for gandalf to show up
[0:20:36] <Docm30> Good joke Jesse
[0:20:43] <the_elusive_robert_denby> cumming
[0:20:50] <bbuckethead> the venus is a waste of money you can just fuck a normal briefcase for half the price
[0:20:51] <nickconga> jake, jesse did a good joke
[0:20:54] <love_too_watch_games> Jesse, unmute your mic in discord
[0:21:01] <wutpie> I love Jesse Farrar
[0:21:02] <pbasil> Jesse, use the good gun wisely
[0:21:03] <Sinesthetic> wait - are we now witnessed the third entry in jesse's t-shirt collection?
[0:21:05] <bluishzulu> sometimes its as simple as restarting discord
[0:21:08] <pbasil> Don't get shot
[0:21:08] <yarightdude> Unmute your mic in discord, Jesse
[0:21:15] <rodzirvin> Jesse is picke rick, he can fix it

[0:22:01] <bluishzulu> if you are in a lobby try a direct call
[0:22:03] <pbasil> They're shooting!
[0:22:12] <Sinesthetic> stefan's violent unboxing needs video to go with audio
[0:22:14] <sensibleb> Unboxing video of Gwynneth Paltrow's head
[0:22:19] <yarightdude> thats a good buy
[0:22:47] <rodzirvin> More than 3? Millionaire podcaster
[0:22:57] <Docm30> Jesse has been killing it with good jokes
[0:23:02] <durbeyfield> jesse laughed
[0:23:02] <yarightdude> Jesse: That's a good idea
[0:23:03] <bluishzulu> "thats a bad idea jake"
[0:23:08] <durbeyfield> lol
[0:23:10] <the_elusive_robert_denby> crew socks instead of a venus, very economical
[0:23:11] <prof_hardcastle> he said I've got a thicc bae with a fam
[0:23:11] <grindspore> He did mention that you look like a pedophile.
[0:23:20] <pbasil> Jesse said he has more than three t-shirts
[0:23:20] <Sinesthetic> lol rob
[0:23:21] <NHLPlayerToreyKrug> Jesse "owns" "many"

[0:23:27] <bluishzulu> IT WORKS FOR DISCORD FUCK U JAKE
[0:23:36] <sharkbutt> he's not wrong
[0:23:38] <pbasil> He says he owns "many"
[0:23:43] <pbasil> But he doesn't want to brag
[0:23:45] <Docm30> Jesse actually said that

[0:24:02] <keepo__man> delete system32
[0:24:08] <the_elusive_robert_denby> maybe he's muted in discord
[0:24:11] <bluishzulu> "what do you want me to plug in"
[0:24:31] <prof_hardcastle> Jesse's Venus is really loud. Maybe that's stealing power from the computer?
[0:24:46] <sharkbutt> try plugging is dis cord
[0:24:48] <pbasil> Jesse you're in the top 50
[0:24:50] <pbasil> Good job!

[0:25:15] <durbeyfield> "Minor Threat, that sounds like Stefan in the school yard"
[0:25:19] <Docm30> Jesse said Stefan is a threat to minors
[0:25:21] <mikelenehan> get mike hale to fix this
[0:25:34] <grindspore> "Minor Threat? That's what Stefan looks like when he's in a schoolyard"

[0:32:33] <prof_hardcastle> They call me the masturbation machine around town.
[0:32:34] <mcdaines> Omg
[0:32:35] <bluishzulu> @stefanandjesse jesse, when you fall at the beginning you want to angle as far downward as you can. if you hit 234 you fall the fastest

[0:35:49] <sharkbutt> ‚ÄúI am one of those people who believe in doing it right the first time. When I purchased my Venus, I bought all of the attachments available. I use the Head Massager for foreplay. If ‚ÄòMr. Happy‚Äô doesn‚Äôt want to play I ‚ÄòPump‚Äô up his ego. Then the Receiver strokes me into ecstasy. My partner loves her nipples massaged while she is riding her Sybian. Venus truly does it all! What fantastic products.‚Äù~G.R. ‚Äì Australia
