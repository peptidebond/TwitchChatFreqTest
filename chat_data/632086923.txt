[0:38:12] <Down10_> You will want to turn it off
[0:38:12] <0mnivore> We watched that a lot as kids
[0:38:13] <CarltonBanksEsq> stefan would love it

[0:39:13] <metalgearlenin> Jesse "Right into the double play" Farrar
[0:39:23] <kordle> New Malick joint A Hidden Life is probably the most beautiful movie I've ever seen.
[0:39:23] <chormbly> I just gave in and ate Cinnamon Toast Crunch
[0:39:24] <glockaspaniel> jackass 3 is honestly the most brutal one
[0:39:29] <bobricebobrice> back on the jewel? hey that albums not out yet!
[0:39:38] <sluggboi> double play is when jf puts his keys in the bowl
[0:39:40] <carpenter_groot> i watched all three recently and it was probably my least favorite
[0:39:42] <farthammer1> WOW
[0:39:42] <Down10_> Jackass 3 is on the Twitch Watch Party list, btw
[0:39:43] <mmmmspaghetti> hidden life was a perfectly filmed movie

[0:42:08] <tinybaby> just doing my own thing now instead of watching the stream
[0:42:09] <farthammer1> Can't believe people are interrupting our conversation about Jackass 4 with this Civ 7 stuff
[0:42:10] <hrkac> looking forward to judging the kings based on what civ they pick
[0:42:11] <Down10_> JF would dig it
[0:42:14] <Source_Force> When Stefan plays it's Civ 6.5
[0:42:17] <rodzirvin> @GoOffKings Twitch says Jackass 3 is available for watch parties

[0:42:40] <etrigan34> JF needs some plate discipline
[0:42:41] <Down10_> Actually Civ could be a game both Stefan and JF could get into, possibly
[0:42:45] <MikeASchneider> yeah
[0:42:47] <ApollOrc> only asking for 3 Jackass
[0:42:49] <tinybaby> it was five guys. it was just on twitter

[0:42:55] <Dealeylama> Nick wiger made the joke
[0:42:55] <glockaspaniel> jesse said it
[0:42:59] <rodzirvin> A pioneer
[0:43:00] <McCainFlightSchool> JF telling Chris he has n+1 more ex-wives than he does is still one of my favorite things

[0:43:10] <Chexoid> it would be really funny if the Five Guys tweet was one of the JF tweets where everyone gets pissed at him for it
[0:43:11] <Down10_> Jesse "Innovator" Farrar
[0:43:11] <tinybaby> it's from before the stream

[0:56:53] <carlm0nday> that's a good spot
[0:56:54] <oldnick42> It just means make trade routes Jesse.
[0:56:56] <big__soda> jesse famously hates board games and this is basically a board game

[0:57:04] <Cornetto_32> @GoOffKings found your city with your settlers right where they are
[0:57:06] <00nola> after the first city you have to settle a new one as fast as possible and build a road between
[0:57:08] <qsklogic> Build a trader as soon as you can to get a lot of gold

[0:58:02] <DoogieHowserSpankedMySon> you should move him
[0:58:06] <Cornetto_32> the beginning of the game is exploring the map, finding the other civilizations, then you expand to more cities
[0:58:07] <winzigwinsbig> !bigman
[0:58:08] <Nightbot> JESSE TURN OFF THE STREAM
[0:58:11] <Rhettofbodom> explore
[0:58:12] <Chexoid> would be so sick to just live near some elephants
[0:58:13] <qsklogic> Build a warrior first
[0:58:14] <wellhowdypardner> I feel like we had an Egyptology craze in the 90s
[0:58:19] <SHISHKABUTT> build a scout

[0:58:36] <starkimified> neat stuff
[0:58:37] <SamTheNannerMan> i wanna post raw stuff

[0:58:49] <hug_nicemann> great pick
[0:58:49] <DoogieHowserSpankedMySon> slick stuff
[0:58:51] <porchcrop> Let the Civilization begin
[0:58:52] <carlm0nday> mining is good since you have those stones
[0:58:55] <bloviated> who do we think Jesse's first neighbor will be? I bet it'll be a big warlord type
[0:58:57] <wellhowdypardner> anyone else remember Mummies Alive!, the Mummy movies with Brendan Fraiser?
[0:58:57] <qsklogic> Monument, jf going pacifist??
[0:58:59] <Land_Phil> lol
[0:59:00] <Nightbot> that's funny
[0:59:00] <Down10_> Is he still not on Spotify?
[0:59:01] <BroPair> ancient egypt. renowned for its mining
[0:59:02] <00nola> roads are how you make money so exploration and new settlements are key
[0:59:04] <Land_Phil> i haven't heard the fifa one yet
[0:59:05] <Rhettofbodom> scout
[0:59:08] <Cornetto_32> you can use workers to develop tiles meaning you claim the resource on that tile, and then use it to trade with other civilizations that dont have them
[0:59:08] <Grundle_Guy> yeah those are warriors
[0:59:08] <SamTheNannerMan> just explore with them
[0:59:10] <oldnick42> Yeah, explore the map, find people and resources.
[0:59:12] <ApollOrc> what difficulty did he set it to does anyone remember?
[0:59:13] <ghostlikemike> why are you so zoomed in
[0:59:15] <Grundle_Guy> they will hit enemies that they meet
[0:59:16] <Rhettofbodom> he
[0:59:17] <owlyoop> settler @ApollOrc
[0:59:17] <mmmmspaghetti> doing the garth brooks speech before talking to other nations
[0:59:17] <sluggboi> it is cVilisation when Jesse plays (bit of a thinker)
[0:59:17] <wellhowdypardner> the movie Futuresport where the lead white guy called himself The Pharaoh?
[0:59:18] <radicalprofessor> is the bounty to play this with the worst possible camera angle
[0:59:23] <qsklogic> Autos to prince I think
[0:59:23] <Rhettofbodom> he's on settler @ApollOrc
[0:59:24] <drill_the_grass> turn on ballcam
[0:59:25] <bobricebobrice> age of mythology was my shit
[0:59:26] <bluestraveler666> age of mythology was fun
[0:59:26] <Grundle_Guy> bottom right button
[0:59:28] <bloviated> mythology was dope
[0:59:31] <Down10_> There are a total of two Garth Brooks songs on Spotify
[0:59:31] <foygus_> ayja vempyers
[0:59:32] <qsklogic> Look for villages and city states
[0:59:34] <Rhettofbodom> age of mythology was dope, empire earth was alright
[0:59:35] <LRonFrancis> yes
[0:59:37] <chrome_chomsky> empire earth was wild
[0:59:37] <00nola> yes
[0:59:37] <usernamehaver> yes
[0:59:38] <bogenbroom> They messed up the villages early on and you could get a mech stomping around before like the bronze age
[0:59:39] <scubadoo2188> i love it
[0:59:40] <RevRagu> we love papyrus
[0:59:42] <hometownmarkup> yes
[0:59:42] <migrainethresher> i liked Rise of Nations
[0:59:44] <oldnick42> Can we get a "swath of papyrus" going in the chat?
[0:59:44] <BloodWorms> rise of nations was the best rts
[0:59:46] <Grundle_Guy> nope
[0:59:49] <sluggboi> insane pull to identify that as papyrus
[0:59:49] <BroPair> bit cultural-centric to assume thats papyrus
[0:59:50] <bronsonosaurus_rex> yes
[0:59:52] <Rhettofbodom> command and conquer
[0:59:52] <oldnick42> swath of papyrus
[0:59:54] <its_doggety> stuff happens after you take your turn
[0:59:55] <anuscolon> quit this clown game and play Pharaoh like a real man
[0:59:59] <wellhowdypardner> Rise of Nations was great
[0:59:59] <Chexoid> It's Cleopatra VIII Philopator when Jesse's palying
[1:00:00] <oldnick42> swath of papyrus
[1:00:02] <PoochieD> hey guys
[1:00:03] <radicalprofessor> empire earch was great because you could just deadlock in games that no one could win
[1:00:05] <Down10_> Make roads!
[1:00:09] <Cornetto_32> it goes through everybodys turn sequentially, for each civilization and then barbarians etc
[1:00:10] <SamTheNannerMan> don't buy tiles yet
[1:00:10] <Down10_> You'll be glad you did
[1:00:10] <bloviated> ok. normal.
[1:00:11] <considerthetetrapod> Pharaoh slapped ass
[1:00:16] <munt69> gotta get that +4 gold
[1:00:17] <eyeonicDJ> tile!
[1:00:19] <tinybaby> hey jesse are you redoing your bathroom
[1:00:20] <mmmmspaghetti> i ordered from stuff from ikea 4 months ago and it just shipped
[1:00:22] <carpenter_groot> Stefan whats the latest on the PC
[1:00:22] <migrainethresher> take out a loan
[1:00:24] <gweeedo> better get some comet too
[1:00:24] <Cornetto_32> no you buy tiles later when you have money
[1:00:25] <DrOrpheusMD> hardwood is preferred
[1:00:26] <carlm0nday> you get tiles from culture too
[1:00:26] <BroPair> thats great
[1:00:27] <sluggboi> this is just another Jesse store story
[1:00:31] <machopineapple> this is advanced rn.
[1:00:31] <bloviated> tiles will expand on their own gradually
[1:00:35] <00nola> roads
[1:00:39] <tjborg> weird looking baseball field
[1:00:40] <Cornetto_32> 1. explore with warriors, 2. use workers to get resources from tiles
[1:00:40] <panicwearehanginghere> use the motherlode cheat
[1:00:44] <beef__woman> I love George michael
[1:00:45] <SoundAlerts> TrentReznorRamon played Jesse Fart (Loud) for 10 Bits
[1:00:46] <qsklogic> Nothing to do early. Early game should go quick
[1:00:46] <bloviated> you just gotta blow through these early turns there's not much you can do here
[1:00:49] <DoogieHowserSpankedMySon> build a scout
[1:00:51] <naffologist> you can make the "tile" river jf
[1:00:52] <carpenter_groot> shit not even a diagnosis yet?
[1:00:54] <Down10_> set up some auto-explorers
[1:00:58] <McCainFlightSchool> stefan's computer has lung cancer and has died
[1:01:02] <Dealeylama> Prognosis: Negative

[1:01:03] <Cornetto_32> theyre revealing the map
[1:01:04] <mikelenehan> checkin out crabs
[1:01:09] <BUNCHOFCATS> your playing the game
[1:01:11] <oldnick42> It takes turns to do things.
[1:01:12] <ApollOrc> you'll prob run into barbarians eventually
[1:01:16] <SHISHKABUTT> its a slow game
[1:01:18] <BroPair> theyre crabbing
[1:01:18] <DrOrpheusMD> you wait it build and find stuff
[1:01:21] <Down10_> Is chat allowed to coach?
[1:01:21] <jonlovesart> You'll find barbarians eventually and you'll fight them
[1:01:23] <oldnick42> Your cities will build stuff in a few turns, and then you'll have more stuff to manage.
[1:01:24] <chrome_chomsky> theyll kill barbarians
[1:01:25] <Cornetto_32> @gooffkings each turn your city does some production on whatever job it has been assigned
[1:01:26] <Chexoid> nice job JF
[1:01:26] <BUNCHOFCATS> go crabbing
[1:01:28] <machopineapple> they're scouting
[1:01:31] <anuscolon> @considerthetetrapod ya it whipped

[1:01:33] <Tesla_Gangster> i love discovering new continents
[1:01:36] <Down10_> horsies!
[1:01:38] <bogenbroom> how many bits was it again to make Jesse's lovesense go off?
[1:01:39] <qsklogic> It’ll take like two hours before you get to any wars
[1:01:42] <sluggboi> the guys are too big. much bigger than the city. completely destroys the immersion for me
[1:01:44] <BroPair> oh asia minor is "just over there." this tea tho
[1:01:45] <beef__woman> Bigger jurors
[1:01:45] <oldnick42> Jesse - build some units with your city, then when it gets bigger make another settler, and found another city. Rinse and repeat.
[1:01:46] <dogwontstopnuttingHELP> it would've been cool if Beyond Earth was good
[1:01:50] <markovblanket> lol

[1:16:25] <hug_nicemann> not great but it's settler he'll be fine
[1:16:25] <leedo_> not good
[1:16:26] <Down10_> Too early to tell
[1:16:26] <fetty_qwop> not terrible
[1:16:27] <tompeppre> he has no concept of what this game even is
[1:16:27] <SocialistWaluigi> not bad for a first timer
[1:16:27] <thiccmoranis> nothing wrong yet
[1:16:28] <Tesla_Gangster> very slow start but it's okay

[1:16:29] <00nola> he's fine
[1:16:29] <jonlovesart> Not great, but the difficulty is vvv low
[1:16:29] <slow_cheetah> too early to tell
[1:16:29] <Grundle_Guy> bad but he is on the easiest mode so it's probably ok
[1:16:29] <Chexoid> there's not much to do in these early turns so kind of just doing whatever is fine
[1:16:31] <bloviated> too early to be doing bad honestly
