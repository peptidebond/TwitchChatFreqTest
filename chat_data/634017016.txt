[0:26:21] <theoriginalferg> Here's a hot take: I don't wath IASIP!!
[0:26:22] <zany_antics> controversial take here - it's frank
[0:26:22] <DruidUncle> mac, but it's tough
[0:26:22] <mmmmspaghetti> It's Dee
[0:26:23] <acousticreflex> dennis and dee

[0:26:30] <nerfthenukes> charlie
[0:26:30] <Source_Force> Frank because he wasn't there the first season
[0:26:30] <itsmikeo> Mac is the best

[0:26:31] <dmlat> because mac rules
[0:26:32] <acousticreflex> Mac is the best
[0:26:35] <thiccmoranis> mac is incredible
[0:26:36] <Cornetto_32> mac IS the show
[0:26:36] <jacobdotexe> it's mac
[0:26:38] <winzigwinsbig> it’s Frank

[0:26:53] <cosmocat69> Country Mac was my favorite episode
[0:26:55] <jacobdotexe> jesse is correct
[0:26:57] <acousticreflex> his unbridled confidence is amazing
[0:27:00] <big_time_goofus> Frank can go
[0:27:00] <migrainethresher> frank was a late addition so he can go, but he's also the only one on charlie's level
[0:27:02] <bjork_liker> One gotta go: cool stuff, neat stuff, slick stuff, raw stuff

[0:27:59] <Timb0nic> one gotta go simpons
[0:28:01] <DrOrpheusMD> bill ponderosa
[0:28:01] <scottie_b_> anyone but Cricket
[0:28:02] <sawks> frank already wasn't in the show though, those first seasons were still good
[0:28:04] <mmmmspaghetti> Get rid of Frank and it's just season 1.
[0:28:04] <buttbuttpeeman> what restaurant did Artemis fuck in? burger king?
[0:28:04] <Kelbaenor> It’s either dee or Dennis for sure
[0:28:07] <thiccmoranis> dee or dennis
[0:28:07] <hectordoink> it's dennis
[0:28:08] <migrainethresher> dennis and mac fill very similar roles
[0:28:08] <theoriginalferg> this mf said simpons
[0:28:10] <man_brother> Dennis for sure
[0:28:12] <Sogetastic> It's Mac
[0:28:14] <SurkovFan420> dennis has got to stay
[0:28:15] <thundergun20> mac is the most delusional
[0:28:15] <jacobdotexe> It's mac
[0:28:16] <xlcurd> It's Mac
[0:28:17] <coolermaster88> i think it's dee. it can't be mac
[0:28:17] <bad_boy_bubby> dennis can go
[0:28:18] <usernamehaver> dennis goes
[0:28:18] <man_brother> Mac is too good
[0:28:19] <dmchandler> dennis and mac have a lot of overlap
[0:28:20] <TrentReznorRamon> Dee gotta go
[0:28:21] <pecotaredux> can we get a poll on this
[0:28:21] <jibjab_> definitely Dennis
[0:28:22] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> his name is fucking Ronald McDonald, he CAN'T go!
[0:28:22] <WheezTheSnus> Dee or dennis
[0:28:23] <rodzirvin> It's Mac, Dennis' psycho stuff is so hilarious
[0:28:24] <hrkac> not possible. none can go
[0:28:25] <ShieldRJaguar> At least the show proved it worked without frank
[0:28:26] <shanept82> I think it’s Dee. She bring the least.
[0:28:27] <considerthetetrapod> dennis is like, evil
[0:28:29] <Cornetto_32> its dee, its so obvious
[0:28:30] <RevRagu> the dynamics are so perfect for that show i don't think you can take any of them out
[0:28:31] <hexproofusername> Need Larry Seinfeld
[0:28:31] <Source_Force> he's the "smartest" and you need a "smart" one
[0:28:32] <aslongasbassstrings> w/o dennis its a different show, but maybe a good one?
[0:28:33] <Ferice1> but dennis wasent there for half a season
[0:28:33] <big_time_goofus> Dennis’ sociopathic tendencies are great
[0:28:34] <cosmocat69> How many episodes did Dennis miss when he left?
[0:28:34] <shanept82> She’s great, but she brings the least.
[0:28:35] <man_brother> THEY ARE ALSO LOST WITH HIM
[0:28:36] <Ferice1> so hes not that important
[0:28:37] <winzigwinsbig> it’s Frank smfh
[0:28:38] <pecotaredux> that wasn't a good season
[0:28:42] <braddawson> truly no idea what anyone is talking about
[0:28:42] <itsmikeo> to be fair there's a whole season without frank
[0:28:43] <thiccmoranis> yea everyone else being lost sounds fun
[0:28:44] <benchunch> He was only gone one episode
[0:28:48] <cosmocat69> Frank wasn’t there until the second season
[0:28:52] <mikelenehan> frank or dee
[0:28:52] <zany_antics> its definitely frank
[0:28:53] <jacobdotexe> saying mac has had character development is pushing it imo
[0:28:53] <migrainethresher> rickety cricket can fill anyone's role
[0:29:00] <craoulence> guys, CHRIS SAID LARRY SEINFELD
[0:29:05] <cosmocat69> He missed a bunch of episodes yeah
[0:29:07] <craoulence> it can't be said enough
[0:29:08] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> there was a season without frank and it was the worst season
[0:29:14] <Sogetastic> Frank wasn't in the first season either
[0:29:14] <big_time_goofus> It’s frank
[0:29:15] <aslongasbassstrings> hes not in the first couple
[0:29:15] <Source_Force> Frank wasn't even in the first Season. He's in the least episodes so he goes
[0:29:17] <LilStinker> he said what
[0:29:25] <usernamehaver> it can't be dee
[0:29:29] <dmchandler> i think them piling on her and how shes a bummer is good
[0:29:29] <cosmocat69> Dee is the Bill of the group
[0:29:29] <dmlat> but charlie can be really sad
[0:29:31] <scrunkbucket> one gotta go: Larry Seinfeld, Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David, and Jerry David
[0:29:31] <zednaught> folks we all love dee but maybe she gotta go
[0:29:32] <buttson> dee is the punching bag
[0:29:32] <hrkac> i think its a lot darker show if it's all dudes but i cant articulate why
[0:29:32] <JoeBushDotNet> I don't think that any of them should have to go
[0:29:33] <pecotaredux> more than dennis?
[0:29:34] <thiccmoranis> dee is one of the smarter ones but she also gets the most shit
[0:29:37] <DrOrpheusMD> frank's money upped the game of the show
[0:29:37] <bad_boy_bubby> she's the closest to being the straight man
[0:29:39] <thiccmoranis> she straddles both worlds
[0:29:39] <aslongasbassstrings> i think devito reached out because he liked the show
[0:29:39] <qsklogic> Have you seen season 1 of iasip? It sucks
[0:29:43] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> Without Dee, Cricket doesn't exist
[0:29:44] <jacobdotexe> it could be dee for sure but her dynamic with dennis is good. mac is more expendable
[0:29:44] <craoulence> https://clips.twitch.tv/EnjoyableBlitheClintmullinsAllenHuhu
[0:29:48] <CovfefeDobson> the character of Dee is literally written to be the one you would get rid of
[0:29:49] <dmchandler> charlie has no real goals tho so its fine
[0:29:50] <DJ_Dylan27> Charlie is the saddest
[0:29:51] <WheezTheSnus> charlie is tragic
[0:29:53] <headlesspresident> Cosmo Costanza
[0:29:53] <dmchandler> dee is aware she's sad
[0:29:56] <slow_biden> Mac gotta go
[0:29:59] <pecotaredux> It's Mac
[0:30:00] <thundergun20> no charlie is happy with the life he has
[0:30:02] <acousticreflex> wrong.
[0:30:02] <usernamehaver> the dynamic between dee and frank is so good though
[0:30:05] <acousticreflex> not mac.
[0:30:05] <DJ_Dylan27> Bird is not needed.
[0:30:08] <considerthetetrapod> larry seinfeld
[0:30:13] <Sogetastic> Dee is sadder
[0:30:15] <scottie_b_> It's Larry. Get rid of Larry Seinfeld
[0:30:17] <LaOwlLOL> how do we feel about Lucky?
[0:30:20] <Cornetto_32> no Mac can be that
[0:30:20] <CovfefeDobson> wait then what's dee? she's the useless chick! ohhhhhh!!!
[0:30:21] <Sogetastic> Dee is sadder because she knows
[0:30:22] <qfromspace> hey pimps
[0:30:24] <migrainethresher> they did also get rid of the orignial dee when they sold the show
[0:30:26] <winzigwinsbig> stefan is a simp for dee

[0:33:52] <Nightbot> that's funny
[0:33:52] <chrome_chomsky> gang discovers information that could lead to the arrest of hillary clinton
[0:33:52] <dmchandler> i don't think i've seen an episode since season 7 or something, i gotta catch up
[0:33:52] <winzigwinsbig> Mac and Dennis Break Up is my fave
[0:33:52] <pigbart91> Chardee Macdennis
[0:33:53] <Dealeylama> The first season is a little different but it might be my favorite
[0:33:54] <mikelenehan> country mac is so good
[0:33:55] <acousticreflex> gang solves the gas crisis
[0:33:56] <hawesome237> the gang gets analyzed
[0:33:56] <pecotaredux> charlie pulling the tooth is so good
[0:33:57] <JoeBushDotNet> The one where Mac and Charlie get stuck in the pool
[0:34:02] <pecotaredux> no resistance whatsoever
[0:34:07] <itsmikeo> Stranded in the Woods
[0:34:13] <buttson> start in 3 cause frank isn't in season 1 or 2
[0:34:14] <migrainethresher> gotta jump in post-frank at least
[0:34:14] <joshdavisj> Mac and Dennis move to the suburbs is so fucking good
[0:34:19] <Sogetastic> the gang solves the korea crisis
[0:34:20] <usernamehaver> there are some pretty bad ones
[0:34:21] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> season 2 rules
[0:34:24] <RohitBhatti> @cosmocat69 You are hilarious lol
[0:34:25] <cosmocat69> The one where Charlie and Mac do security for the middle school
[0:34:26] <usernamehaver> didn't all age well
[0:34:26] <nerfthenukes> best moment is Frank's fantasy during the gas station robbery.
[0:34:30] <mmmmspaghetti> Who Got Dee Pregnant
[0:34:30] <hrkac> fuck im gonna watch all the episodes again
[0:34:31] <pecotaredux> Worst episode is hands down Frank's Brother
[0:34:39] <owlyoop> ive been wanting to watch sunny. so start at season 2 or 3
[0:34:40] <dmchandler> i'd say it's like the simpsons and it found what it is in season 2, and season 1 was figuring things out
[0:34:41] <SophisticatedPills> 1st season is great i wont stand for this
[0:34:44] <hrkac> @pecotaredux i skip it every time
[0:34:47] <scottie_b_> Extreme Power corrupts extremely
[0:34:49] <Sogetastic> 1st is really good
[0:34:50] <farthammer1> Good evening pimps it is 91 degrees and almost 7pm here and both my kids are in the tighty-whities and fighting on the floor and my wife and I are both drinking and ignoring them but also ready to switch to hard booze. Hope you are all doing great,
[0:34:53] <sawks> jf are you looking at tiktok babes
[0:35:03] <RohitBhatti> The episode where Mac talked about his famous mac cheese lol
[0:35:06] <GoOffKings> @sawks no!
[0:35:07] <corinne_bailey_rae_cyrus> The first episode anyone should watch is Frank's Pretty Woman, after that they can just choose whatever
[0:35:08] <WheezTheSnus> worst episode is the wiz style musical
[0:35:09] <dmchandler> @owlyoop 1st season is good! It gets better but it's good
[0:35:10] <big_time_goofus> Farthammer said jesde
[0:35:12] <pecotaredux> Thousand Dollar Baby is season 2, right? That one's really good
[0:35:19] <RohitBhatti> Franks Brother episode SUCKS

[0:35:27] <Sogetastic> The hardest I've laughed is when they reveal Mac's full name
[0:35:28] <buttson> INTERVENTION
[0:35:31] <coolermaster88> ongo goblogian
[0:35:31] <mmmmspaghetti> Charlie Work is an all time classic.
[0:35:39] <dmlat> Wade Boggs episode was great too
[0:35:40] <IncrediDick> the recent sexual harassment seminar one was great
[0:35:40] <pecotaredux> Intervention is so good
[0:35:42] <acousticreflex> charlie work is fucking perfect
[0:35:47] <beef__woman> Hundred dollar baby
[0:35:47] <buttson> the aluminum monster vs fatty mcgee
[0:35:47] <farthammer1> Gotta Bowl sounds like a Sopranos thing
[0:35:48] <turpin4prez> Who Pooped the Bed is my favorite
[0:35:51] <migrainethresher> remember how the dad from 7th heaven is a pedophile
[0:35:52] <mmmmspaghetti> Gang Beats Boggs and Intervention are also great
[0:35:52] <RohitBhatti> LOOOL
[0:35:53] <CDBreakfast> I love the lady from 1000 dollar lady that sells Dee the drugs
[0:35:54] <RohitBhatti> The best
[0:35:54] <JonesMcPwnz> which is the one where Frank looks like the Penguin and goes on about not diddling kids?
[0:35:56] <jacobdotexe> how has the musical not been mentioned
[0:36:00] <steveearlesweatshirt> who pooped the bed
[0:36:05] <acousticreflex> country mac!
[0:36:08] <WheezTheSnus> the wiz style musical is the worst ep by far
[0:36:09] <thiccmoranis> the gang solves the gas crisis
[0:36:10] <jacobdotexe> that is the best episode of TV of any show
[0:36:13] <considerthetetrapod> country mac rules
[0:36:15] <dmchandler> fast!
[0:36:15] <acousticreflex> project bad ass off the bridge
[0:36:16] <CDBreakfast> "men are such pigs huh"

[0:36:20] <pigbart91> steal
[0:36:24] <cosmocat69> Frank’s little Beauties was it

[0:38:47] <BasementHippo> i remember I had a few episodes from season 1 on my ipod video
[0:38:47] <Land_Phil> i like the wrestling one
[0:38:47] <TrentReznorRamon> skip season 1. no frank
[0:38:48] <BreenIsGod> Buys a Boat just for The Implication
[0:38:51] <winzigwinsbig> I love the wrestling ep
[0:38:55] <slow_biden> is extreme home makeover season 2?
[0:38:56] <winzigwinsbig> with Roddy Piper
[0:38:56] <ARealLifeBear> I'll make another effort, it was just a particular episode that was like, yipes
[0:39:00] <sawks> i like the abortion clinic episode though
[0:39:01] <Down10_> Season 1 of Seinfeld is not good
[0:39:02] <itsmikeo> Love watching "Larry Seinfeld on Crack" on my PS3
[0:39:05] <ChuddTruckley> i'd just watch all of them
[0:39:07] <noprankradio> stop talking about Larry seinfeld ffs
[0:39:08] <winzigwinsbig> home makeover was 3 or 4 i think
[0:39:09] <ChuddTruckley> incl. season 1
[0:39:12] <scrunkbucket> stefan doesn't watch shows that only had one season
[0:39:14] <man_brother> Hey and you know whats crazy, its kind of like the city of Philadelphia is also a character!!
[0:39:16] <itsmikeo> !larry
[0:39:16] <Nightbot> Chris said Larry Seinfeld https://clips.twitch.tv/TentativeTenderCheesecakeTBCheesePull
[0:39:16] <farthammer1> ALL seasons of Seinfeld aren't good
[0:39:17] <pigbart91> community is must view season one
[0:39:18] <SophisticatedPills> gun fever is quintessential
[0:39:18] <hawesome237> The gang hits the slopes is one of my faves
[0:39:24] <farthammer1> Seinfeld blows
[0:39:24] <migrainethresher> the evolution of all the side characters is important
[0:39:25] <hectordoink> you gotta see the prgression for some characters they're so good
[0:39:26] <rodzirvin> Early seasons you get more McPoyles
[0:39:27] <pecotaredux> I was watching Sunny from the beginning and holy shit in the beginning I was 14
[0:39:28] <themattymac> Jesse what's up
[0:39:30] <fishclamps1> cricket on the podcast episode is amazing
[0:39:30] <theoverluk> good point man brother
[0:39:34] <MikeASchneider> community is the opposite, season one only
[0:39:35] <PretzelRocks> Now Playing: Super Boy of Little Powers by Chipzel -> https://prtzl.to/pYHlkx3mcV
[0:39:37] <ChuddTruckley> the christmas episode owns
[0:39:37] <gweeedo> the end of an early season ep where charlie cries is an amazing moment
[0:39:37] <mmmmspaghetti> It's less popular but I love The Gang Wrestles for the Troops
[0:39:38] <farthammer1> Season 1 of Sopranos was GREAT
[0:39:40] <pecotaredux> gas crisis episode is great
[0:39:41] <JoeBushDotNet> The development of the waitress character over time is so good too, I think that could be lost if you jump around through it
[0:39:42] <noprankradio> how do you ban a term in the chat
[0:39:48] <McCainFlightSchool> Sopranos is the best
[0:39:52] <headlesspresident> hello chris
[0:39:53] <Jka618> which term chris
[0:39:54] <puzzlemustard> hello noprank
[0:40:00] <sawks> jerry david
[0:40:05] <cosmocat69> Hellllllo, Larry Seinfeld
[0:40:05] <rodzirvin> They moved them to FXX
[0:40:06] <pigbart91> farthammer you are right i think Stefans rule only applies to comedies
[0:40:07] <mmmmspaghetti> chris wants to ban larry seinfeld
[0:40:07] <slow_biden> oh, the welfare episode!
[0:40:07] <pbostrom> which one is Larry?
[0:40:07] <benchunch> chris is there a particular term you're talking about?
[0:40:09] <DrOrpheusMD> the flashback episode where they do the seinfeld bit is great

[1:01:49] <pigbart91> Metalhead tell JF whos the best team
[1:01:51] <cosmocat69> NO DH
[1:01:54] <considerthetetrapod> @MetalheadSoft did you guys make ocarina of time
[1:01:57] <Land_Phil> yes DH
[1:01:59] <cosmocat69> the DH is an abomination to the sport
[1:02:02] <MetalheadSoft> @puzzlemustard the whole team has different favorites. Richard, one of our leader developers, is a Platypi fan
[1:02:07] <farthammer1> DH rules. Pitchers are a waste in the lineup.
[1:02:09] <Land_Phil> @cosmocat69 no it's not
[1:02:13] <ARealLifeBear> I always called DH the "diarrhea rule" as a small child

[1:02:25] <listenerdave> Late July, great chips
[1:02:25] <cosmocat69> It takes more strategy to win with pitchers hitting. More fun to watch
[1:02:26] <Land_Phil> i htink the entire lineup should be full of DH's
[1:02:26] <considerthetetrapod> @MetalheadSoft sick

[1:03:19] <mileyvirus> not to mention the staffs and all that
[1:03:23] <winzigwinsbig> each team should pick one player and do a 30 team 1 on 1 playoffs
[1:03:32] <Chexoid> lakers
[1:03:38] <DaneKnight> stefan if vancouver got a team would you still root for toronto?
[1:03:54] <rallyspirit> you both played as them

[1:04:22] <carpenter_groot> NBA seems content to continue with 30 teams
[1:04:23] <jamberg> Kansas City also maybe
[1:04:27] <jamberg> Virginia Beach got thrown out there
[1:04:29] <pigbart91> jf i think memphis might move
[1:04:31] <springbreakmyheart> How legitimate will we consider results? Does it depend if it's chalk

[1:04:41] <JoeBushDotNet> Badminton Rob
[1:04:41] <swamp_dweller9> basketball baby

[1:04:45] <cosmocat69> Rob pick the Buffalo Bills
[1:04:46] <Land_Phil> ISOTOPES!
[1:04:48] <xlcurd> Nuggets is a crazy team name. you get drafted and call your mom to tell her "mom, I'm a nugget"
[1:04:51] <carpenter_groot> Tacoma Rainiers
[1:04:56] <cosmocat69> For AAA baseball pick the Rochester Red Wings

[1:05:06] <DaneKnight> nba is the best league rob
[1:05:08] <rodzirvin> Rob, choose Red Star Belgrade

[1:05:23] <mister_snipes_> those guys are true freakshows
[1:05:25] <ARealLifeBear> glasses are a game changer
[1:05:25] <jamberg> they're not humans

[1:06:10] <DaneKnight> i saw someone positively comparing AI to Morant

[1:06:17] <pigbart91> i went to an nba playoff game one time and it ruled so hard. Thunder/Rockets
[1:06:17] <rodzirvin> I can't go to a hockey game in person because I'd be surrounded by Bruins fans

[1:06:45] <TheGreatCactusJac> DINGER
[1:06:46] <coach_mike_dan_tony> I've been to one NHL game in my life at the Blackhawks and the crowd stood and applauded the national anthem for the entire song. it was very awkward
[1:06:46] <LilacWhimski> college football in person rules, but also incredibly evil sport
[1:06:46] <Timb0nic> Hockey is just the best
[1:06:47] <listenerdave> live viewing soccer rules

[1:07:13] <jamberg> i watch a bunch of it because i was BORN a moron, but it's not good. the screen is just too small to really get the cool parts
[1:07:15] <cosmocat69> Regular baseball is so calming for me
[1:07:16] <MyHeroZer0> basketball is my favorite game to play and least favorite to watch
[1:07:19] <hawesome237> Playoff baseball is so good

[1:07:27] <mister_snipes_> sunday afternoon
[1:07:28] <cosmocat69> Hearing Gary, Keith and Ron in the booth is my ASMR
[1:07:29] <Sport_Watcher_420> it's the perfect "do some shit" sport
[1:07:34] <nasty_nasty_nasty> regular baseball is great to watch on tv bc you can put it on every night and have something to halfway pay attention to while playing video game
[1:07:34] <00nola> agree jf
[1:07:36] <awgibson> watching golf is very good
[1:07:38] <pigbart91> soccer lowkey best on tv and live
[1:07:43] <carpenter_groot> baseball is a radio sport
[1:07:44] <cosmocat69> I miss the Mets announcers more than I miss the Meta
[1:07:45] <M_Go_Dead> top level tennis live is so different than on TV, it is so much faster, TV makes it look slow

[1:07:55] <clamiam45> I love lunch too. I started eating a second lunch at nighttime too
[1:07:56] <considerthetetrapod> college lunch versus pro lunch
[1:07:57] <RevRagu> golf is fun but all golf courses need to be expropriated and turned into parks

[1:08:03] <farthammer1> @M_Go_Dead Went to Indian Wells a few years in a row. Love it.
[1:08:04] <ClassicMach> If you’re looking for community soccer is probably the way to go.

[1:08:20] <LaOwlLOL> watching soccer at bar... now that's fun.
[1:08:21] <sharkbutt> lunch rocks
[1:08:23] <springbreakmyheart> how about fringe sports.
[1:08:34] <jamberg> soccer on the stream in quibiblio mode is the only way to watch the sport
[1:08:36] <mmmmspaghetti> soccer rules because it's on all the time all year long basically
[1:08:44] <dmchandler> @springbreakmyheart curling is fun during the olympics to me
[1:08:45] <sawks> football #1
[1:08:49] <cosmocat69> Football at a bar or restaurant is the best
[1:08:51] <jamberg> football is #1 for sure
[1:08:51] <rodzirvin> I got to interview a couple of Liverpool players... they look so normal
[1:08:52] <pigbart91> football at a bar rules

[1:57:54] <migrainethresher> cheeto christ is at least appropriately expensive to play
[1:57:57] <serpentine666> and yet this one is so much more expensive
[1:58:06] <pigbart91> cheeto christ is at least making fun of something and has jokes. pant suit anthem is just talking down to people.
[1:58:06] <ARealLifeBear> at least some of Randy's lyrics are clever!
[1:58:07] <hectordoink> This one is as least listenable
[1:58:14] <Cornetto_32> nobody said anything about his ability to cum
[1:58:18] <Cornetto_32> its so weird
[1:58:18] <traevore> I always thought the stupidest part of this is when he stalls and just says "don't get it wrong" over and over, then I learned that's part of the real song
