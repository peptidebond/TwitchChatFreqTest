[0:14:17] <Nightbot> I bought a bundt cake for Jesse about a month ago. When I brought it home, he got irritated because he has been trying to eat healthier. So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today.

[0:43:04] <WealthyWalrus> !bundt
[0:43:04] <Nightbot> I bought a bundt cake for Jesse about a month ago. When I brought it home, he got irritated because he has been trying to eat healthier. So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today.
[0:43:11] <GhoulSzn22> is that sound Jesse burning?

[1:29:24] <Nightbot> Hey, if you've got Amazon Prime, you can link it up to your Twitch account and get a free stream subscription! Which you can then use on this stream! Pretty neat!
[1:29:24] <scrunkbucket> der don is atoning by remaining silent for the rest of the game
[1:29:25] <rodzirvin> Got in here late cause I've been mesmerized by the Steve Harvey SteveHarveyCon dancing video
[1:29:26] <h_dub_v_lit> Jesse at a party with his opening line, "what kind of snacks do you like?"
[1:29:37] <splinkerbell> guys type jesses hand in the chat so stefan can see it
[1:29:45] <farthammer1> I have come around 100% and think Der Don made a joke
[1:29:49] <oleskunty> double aces

[1:30:05] <drpeepeepoopoo> punished derdon
[1:30:10] <joestalin78> He was definitely joking but it was unclear why he thought it was funny
[1:30:14] <patbicks> Der Don decides to take some time off, to listen
[1:30:19] <scubadoo2188> I had to leave for a second, any neo-nazis join while I was gone?
[1:30:23] <h_dub_v_lit> King shit jf

[1:30:30] <splinkerbell> what did der don do
[1:30:31] <farthammer1> Der Don is going to become Jokerfied
[1:30:32] <chrome_chomsky> big hand
[1:30:33] <swegw8> Humor rarely translates well
[1:30:36] <scrunkbucket> put der don in a virtual pillory
[1:30:39] <joestalin78> maybe it was a translation error. probably meant to say "if only he was a Jew"
[1:30:43] <rodzirvin> Jesse's pokerface is so bad you can see it through VR
[1:30:46] <EpochError> hell of a flop, we talking about gigli
[1:30:47] <durkuniverse> lol
[1:30:47] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:30:54] <thiccmoranis> maybe der don made a joke but its not a great place to go for the first joke you attempt
