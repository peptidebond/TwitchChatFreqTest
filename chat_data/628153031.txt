What I’m trying to say is, maybe your brain isn’t working either, but that’s OK, because you’re great. PS you need a firmware upgrade in the form of “coffee.”

[0:01:48] <Nightbot> I bought a bundt cake for Jesse about a month ago. When I brought it home, he got irritated because he has been trying to eat healthier. So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today.

[0:13:30] <Nightbot> I am one of those people who believe in doing it right the first time. When I purchased my Venus, I bought all of the attachments available. I use the Head Massager for foreplay. If ‘Mr. Happy’ doesn’t want to play I ‘Pump’ up his ego. Then the Receiver strokes me into ecstasy. My partner loves her nipples massaged while she is riding her Sybian. Venus truly does it all! What fantastic products.

[0:59:26] <ghoulsnightout_> He seems genuinely nice, he’s just not my thing comedy wise
