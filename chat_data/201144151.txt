[0:17:20] <Smiggs_> What the fuck are you talking about jesse?
[0:17:23] <vegangothcrossfit> jesse's confusion is palpable
[0:17:27] <NHLPlayerToreyKrug> LMAO he was "IN A TEN"
[0:17:30] <the_elusive_robert_denby> are you all too young to remember jacking it to scrambled porn on cable?
[0:17:32] <wutpie> What was his name
[0:17:38] <SHISHKABUTT> is the baby head covering something important
[0:17:43] <biggest_fans> Everyone follow the stream so stefan can jack off with the phone
[0:17:44] <sausagehobbit> jesse has never jacked off
[0:17:45] <lankdan> Stefan sleeps nude in an oxygen tent he believes gives him sexual powers
[0:17:51] <d_o_n_n_y_> jesse has never nutted
[0:17:56] <ghostlikemike> jesse is a mormon
[0:17:58] <thredds> jesse is a wholesome young man
[0:17:59] <djfoss> jesse fucked a watermelon but he didn't finish in it
[0:17:59] <springconvert> Is that baby really there in that painting?
[0:18:02] <GlassRadish> big (his nuts) if true

[0:18:14] <umjammer_danny> jesse fucked a raw turkey
[0:18:15] <garyoussy> hes got the chaturbate thing in his butt
[0:18:19] <sausagehobbit> jesse needs a sybian more now than ever
[0:18:21] <doctorbug> that big controller was much like a sybian
[0:18:25] <humbletales> it doesnt work
[0:18:25] <fktolivejasmine> this is precisely why he doesn't understand the sybian
[0:18:26] <SHISHKABUTT> venus for men hell yeah
[0:18:27] <springconvert> If you all listen to YKS you know Jesse jacks off
[0:18:30] <GlassRadish> lmao the uncomfort on Jesse's face
[0:18:35] <biggest_fans> All roads lead back to the sybian

[0:20:15] <springconvert> If only
[0:20:15] <johnwaynegassy> I'm enjoying the John Olerud helmet material
[0:20:22] <Kevinski> Definitely no sound when the new sub or followers sex toys come on
[0:20:26] <byrdmachine> Can Jesse hear the game audio?
[0:20:29] <lordbeef> was it a royal blunder
[0:20:31] <micr0man> very convincing
[0:20:32] <dad_as_heck> goddamn this is a good layout
[0:20:32] <ghostlikemike> really convincing
[0:20:33] <nickconga> jesse hates jacking off
[0:20:35] <artdamage> i first whacked off in the bathtub and got soap inside my dick
[0:20:36] <lankdan> stefan what's the deal with these golden knights
[0:20:38] <SHISHKABUTT> is there game audio
[0:20:48] <oldnick42> Jesse the new YKS where you were all alone was kind of dark but was very funny

[0:21:15] <fktolivejasmine> no sound at all yeah
[0:21:18] <ghostlikemike> jesse fucked it up
