[0:56:51] <eyeonicDJ> @eponeen nice
[0:56:55] <alexmcdonald_age11> The joke sounded a bit over-saturated in Q mode.
[0:57:03] <ElegantMeats> such broad comedy does not play well on this efficiently narrow screen
[0:57:06] <GhoulSzn22> more like Two Point Ooooooooooof

[1:07:01] <andyateacrayon> I think some of the highly upvoted ones are worse because somehow people actually liked those

[1:31:08] <Down10_> you need to do that "hmm" bit more
[1:31:13] <dreww> Appreciate the thoughts man! And started in video sketch (got a new one pinned on my reddit page if you care to check it out) but have been doing the stand up thing for the last 5 years. This particular joke is one I’ve done on stage a bunch and it’s quite consistent, but think it benefits from my pauses and delivery. That being said it doesn’t necessarily make it the best stand up shot. Regardless thanks for the comment and appreciate feedback both positive and constructive. Have a good one!

[1:52:46] <robertforry> good policy
[1:52:50] <hrkac> but did he say it was a good thing that it was happening
[1:52:59] <cn_monoxide> I’m definitely a “Chris” guy
[1:53:21] <robertforry> how much did quibiblio cost?
[1:53:24] <tacobellass> could you imagine last night's match on quibiblio mode?
[1:53:26] <jack__blac> kingsDb
[1:53:27] <andyateacrayon> want some more stand up shots
[1:53:30] <buttbuttpeeman> It's not a bit Chris. It's the future.
[1:53:34] <turpin4prez> are we ever going to learn the backstory behind "ooohh I'm houston"
[1:53:37] <noodledealerpro> What if everyone was in quibiblio mode except Chris
[1:53:37] <Down10_> that sounds neat
[1:53:41] <Cornetto_32> vr quibiblio would be overwhelming
[1:53:41] <one_bad_hamburger> lol
[1:53:41] <Nightbot> that's funny
[1:53:47] <BroPair> oof
[1:53:49] <wwardlaw> Jim could be there
[1:53:51] <serpentine666> friend44Bjn
[1:53:54] <andyateacrayon> what does his fridge look like in quibiblio mode?

[1:54:02] <Realistic69> not a bad joke
[1:54:07] <GhoulSzn22> @turpin4prez i would like to know as well
[1:54:08] <anniexiety> id like to see mitches fridge in quibiblio mode
[1:54:11] <JasonUnknown> friend44Bjn
[1:54:12] <BroPair> you know what mitch cant do with the ice cube. kick it under the fridge
[1:54:14] <DoogieHowserSpankedMySon> and apparently you can hide your history
[1:54:21] <sharkbutt> we've entered a new golden age in terms of ripping on mitch's fridge
[1:54:22] <robertforry> i bet it looks tall
[1:54:25] <sputnik111> could we see some of quibis amazing turnstile abilities? I'd like to see it switch back and forth to catch all those hidden secrets out of frame!
[1:54:26] <andyateacrayon> classified info

[1:54:29] <McCainFlightSchool> it would break quibiblio mode
[1:54:29] <therudebeast> mitch's fridge looks like a floor lamp in quibiblio mode
[1:54:31] <markovblanket> it would collapse
[1:54:35] <lipwipwipwip> it will look like this: |
[1:54:35] <tacobellass> too highly optimized
[1:54:44] <noodledealerpro> It’s 1 dimensional
[1:54:56] <scrunkbucket> quibiblio mode cancels it out and it just looks like a normal fridge
[1:55:00] <therudebeast> if mitch put his fridge sideways on the stream it would be a cube
[1:55:03] <markovblanket> quifridgelio
[1:55:03] <robertforry> gotta spend a few more billion for fridge tech
[1:55:11] <anniexiety> stefan i mist say you look beautiful in quibiblio mode

[1:58:52] <oldnick42> Quibiblio mode speeds up soccer games because the field isn't as long.
[1:58:55] <buttdog69> I think Ellen sounds chill.
[1:58:58] <buttbuttpeeman> but she seems so wonderful on her show
[1:59:00] <markovblanket> gotta adjust your vision to the superior quibiblio mode
[1:59:01] <eboe> im sorry its my eyes that are the problem
[1:59:02] <McCainFlightSchool> Ellen be like I love committing war crimes!
[1:59:05] <robertforry> her producer is a very cool guy
[1:59:10] <goodfriendjake> my mom watches ellen and i saw a minute of it today and its like an eric andre bit

[1:59:28] <Dealeylama> Greg Fitzsimmons used To work for Ellen and he fucking hates her
[1:59:33] <buttdog69> never cared for conans
[1:59:36] <hrkac> apparently theres a doc of conan where he comes off not great also
[1:59:36] <therudebeast> i'd let conan boss me around
[1:59:42] <farthammer1> I love it when Gourley gets him with one
[1:59:43] <TaintEnthusiast> is that why he put kissinger's son in charge of his company
[1:59:44] <europeansheep> he seems like a yeller
[1:59:44] <serpentine666> plus his game sucked!
[1:59:45] <andyateacrayon> His old late night show tho I do believe is very very good
[1:59:51] <RohitBhatti> bday5000 Hi Stefan, Chris, and Jesse. I hate Pete Holmes too! She is a massive jerk and Ellen is the worst
[1:59:53] <oldnick42> I kind of feel like the NBC screw job broke him.
[1:59:53] <cosmocat69> Ehhh I’ve heard stories and Conan is less Ellen mean and more Comedian who doesn’t know how to turn it off mean
[1:59:59] <Nightbot> Listen to T̶o̶i̶l̶e̶t̶ ̶P̶e̶n̶i̶s̶ Blocked Party and rate it 5 stars for Little Stefan! https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/blocked-party/id1442925390?mt=2

[2:00:00] <dmchandler> nooooo he's just joking around and spastic
[2:00:02] <scrunkbucket> conan hasn't felt real feelings since 2010
[2:00:06] <JasonUnknown> Conans documentary was like that too
[2:00:06] <andyateacrayon> yeah his old show so fucking good
[2:00:07] <JuggaloZizek> I used to love conan
[2:00:09] <farthammer1> Anytime Gourley gets one in and Sonya laughs, it makes me happy
[2:00:20] <anniexiety> i was a huge conan fan and went and saw his show in LA but when i watched the doc about him i stopped loving him
[2:00:22] <Down10_> Yeah, the change to TBS was not a good one
[2:00:23] <lipwipwipwip> yeah conan seems like he's pissed that he has to do his podcast

[2:06:47] <starkimified> chris can have a little chicken, as a treat
[2:06:47] <Timb0nic> We wouldn't have the Popeyes sandwich without the Wendy's sandwich
[2:06:49] <sharkbutt> chicken is pretty good tbh
