[0:18:53] <Nightbot> I bought a bundt cake for Jesse about a month ago. When I brought it home, he got irritated because he has been trying to eat healthier. So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today.

[0:18:59] <Nightbot> I used Venus last night, on a very slow speed with my flaccid cock, while watching a movie on television. I had the most intense orgasm from Venus than from any time in my past, even when I was a young stud with multiple partners. So, once again, THANK YOU. Your product is everything you advertise. I will be using it at least once a week. I will be ordering lots more lube.

[0:19:03] <Nightbot> I learned Magic for eight years. Traveled to La-La Land. Learned how to work with Rockets. I went and learned to fly with some Hawks. Got stung by the Hornets — just a joke. But through all of that, it’s taught me how to be a Wizard.

So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today.
