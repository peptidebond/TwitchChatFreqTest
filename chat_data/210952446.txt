[0:49:52] <mooingmoose> Canadian A&W yeah, Amicable and Wonderful
[0:49:54] <GolferInCheeto> #sexvacation
[0:49:55] <123balls_> What is A&W?
[0:49:58] <umjammer_danny> why did he get a deadmau5 helmet
[0:50:01] <d_o_n_n_y_> anyone remember the Amburgers & Woot beer video
[0:50:01] <billmaher42069> jesse "sex vacation" farrar
[0:50:05] <d_o_n_n_y_> classic stuff
[0:50:08] <nickconga> long john silvers is the worst food
[0:50:18] <jt60564> lol jesse was trying
[0:50:21] <springconvert> I can‚Äôt imagine what would lead me to go into a long John silvers/a&w
[0:50:27] <MacPuzy> Tim Hortons is fucking horrible and the most embarrassing thing about being Canadian
[0:50:30] <bogenbroom> Stefan I'm thinking of going to Canada for vacation this winter. Can you recommend a city?
[0:50:31] <prof_hardcastle> damn are all canadians on a first name basis with mr horton?
[0:50:32] <DUBU_INFO> Stefan: biscuit, english muffin, or bagel for your sandwich?
[0:50:34] <keepo__man> this is how you get a canadian going
[0:50:35] <CovfefeDobson> tims coffee is super overrated
[0:50:46] <Yaya_> Canadian A&W has good honey mustard sauce which is probably one of the greatest achievements a fast food place could have
[0:50:53] <CovfefeDobson> mcdonalds has better coffee
[0:51:00] <oldnick42> Tim Torkons
[0:51:01] <mcdonnellpf> tim hortons kicks ass and i had their visa credit card and it broke 4 times
[0:51:05] <bluishzulu> @stefanandjesse Id like robs thoughts on salami as a snack. perhaps with some cheez its
[0:51:10] <staryuyu> roll up the rim to win
[0:51:11] <Al930> jesse please use your turbo strategically and stop constantly holding the turbo button
[0:51:12] <mcdonnellpf> you have to roll your R Jesse
[0:51:14] <d_o_n_n_y_> Jesse knows all about Rimming
[0:51:14] <awooga> Roy Moore should have rolled up the rim
[0:51:21] <jt60564> personally id prefer an american muffin
[0:51:24] <Knul> lots in detroit
[0:51:24] <DUBU_INFO> buffalo has a lot of them and they're way better
[0:51:28] <d_o_n_n_y_> yeah there's some scattered about
[0:51:31] <ghostlikemike> Cracker Barrel go to?
[0:51:35] <keepo__man> buffalo has too many one could say
[0:51:37] <misterlunchtime> @stefanandjesse stefan im about to go smoke real quick, you think you can update me on what i miss when i get back?
[0:51:38] <mcdonnellpf> America runs on Duncan
[0:51:38] <memeking2> minnesota has one that just opened
[0:51:38] <Al930> no tim horton's in philly
[0:51:40] <prof_hardcastle> we have a hortons in missouri
[0:51:40] <ghostlikemike> meal?
[0:51:40] <NoamChompy> In Michigan all over
[0:51:42] <DUBU_INFO> in toronto they don't even bother toasting the biscuits anymore
[0:51:56] <keepo__man> thats fucked
[0:51:58] <bogenbroom> They are calling for a fucking recount
[0:52:00] <staryuyu> roll up the rim to win
[0:52:07] <d_o_n_n_y_> there are three tim hortons in St. Louis
[0:52:10] <springconvert> That sounds fun
[0:52:16] <d_o_n_n_y_> i think they're focused on hockey towns
[0:52:26] <DUBU_INFO> jesse likes cold biscuits
[0:52:26] <mcdonnellpf> Stefan the trick i figured out is to buy a huge container of coffee and they give you like 20 roll up the rim cups
[0:52:28] <Boomhauer1988> all the tim hortons are closing because their new parent company is breaking the franchisee leases... or something
[0:52:30] <MacPuzy> Hearing anyone pump Tim‚Äôs tires makes me feel sad
[0:52:31] <ghostlikemike> do they even have cracker barrel in canada?
[0:52:33] <mooingmoose> roll up the rim? stefan forgets to pull down the rim after he's done in the restroom
[0:52:34] <Johndorian1337> Is it a real biscuit or an english muffin
[0:52:35] <springconvert> Everything is better toasted
[0:52:35] <pigstypnw> they should recount the biscuits
[0:52:36] <ShooterMart> The dream isn't dead Jesse!!
[0:52:37] <yarightdude> You toast toast not biscuits
[0:52:40] <keepo__man> the roy moore camp is calling for a recount
[0:52:43] <Yaya_> Roy Moore doesn't have a concession speech written which is the reason they're stalling this hard
[0:52:52] <d_o_n_n_y_> yeah a biscuit is already cooked
[0:52:52] <keepo__man> man you got him going off on biscuits friend
[0:52:53] <partnardy> roll up the rim happens during Lent to stop catholics from giving up coffee for Lent
