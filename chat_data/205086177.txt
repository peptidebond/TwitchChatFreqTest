[0:34:42] <Vaihox> Jesse could be a cumboy but he'd probably have to fuck Adam first
[0:34:45] <d_o_n_n_y_> i couldnt hear jesse over the game voice but i assume he said american standard is endorsing the stream
[0:34:46] <Johndorian1337> skyline rules. you guys suck
[0:34:52] <Johndorian1337> Its good on spaghetti
[0:34:58] <dh2121> remember in the first Stefan and Jesse stream when Rob said the N word
[0:35:00] <peepeedingle> Consider muting Jesse please jesse
[0:35:04] <d_o_n_n_y_> the spaghetti stuff is the worst part
[0:35:05] <benghazi_emails> do you guys have chili shirts
[0:35:10] <considerthetetrapod> i like fruitcake
[0:35:11] <blerpo> chili mac is good, but it's better with texas style chili
[0:35:16] <Johndorian1337> Have you actually had it on spaghetti
[0:35:18] <springconvert> Oh I thought skyline was big in spaghetti
[0:35:23] <KeynDooee> Worst regional dish.
[0:35:28] <Johndorian1337> The point is that it's like a rich sauce. Not necessarily spaghetti
[0:35:34] <YKSFAN> Pretending to be the doughboys again
[0:35:39] <Johndorian1337> Or like traditional chili
[0:35:45] <PonDoLaReplay> Jesse go on cumtown

[0:36:51] <red19fire> it's called PIZZELLE and it's trash for trash people
[0:36:53] <Johndorian1337> The point isn't that it's like texas chili
[0:36:53] <considerthetetrapod> st louis has a baseball team for dorks
[0:36:55] <springconvert> That sounds like shit
[0:36:55] <d_o_n_n_y_> its just really thin
[0:36:57] <Johndorian1337> its just the same word for a different dish
[0:37:02] <BuddyGuysman> st louis pizza is so fuckin good
[0:37:06] <Johndorian1337> its like a rich tomato sauce. its not supposed to be like texas chili
[0:37:07] <dh2121> i dont know any bad regional food cause im from chicago
[0:37:10] <KeynDooee> Skyline Chili is glorified diarrheal.
[0:37:14] <Johndorian1337> Its just the same word for two different dishes!!!!
[0:37:16] <benghazi_emails> stl food in general, is like tenement building factory worker food
