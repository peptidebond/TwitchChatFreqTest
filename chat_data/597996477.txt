These types are basically amateur gamers who captivate for reasons that have nothing to do with skilled gaming. Part podcast, part reality show and part friends chilling on the couch, this type of streamer's world is so inviting and fun it sucks you in.

I will be using it at least once a week. I will be ordering lots more lube.

[1:12:30] <RadishGiant> What was that
[1:12:33] <drippedout> i would simply throw him off of the cage

[1:13:19] <metaxylenes> you have to hit alt+f4
[1:13:25] <CoolHand_Sean> question: are there any holds barred?
[1:13:25] <drippedout> john's got somewhere important to be
[1:13:26] <jibjab_> To dive off cell: This involves the same situation as throwing an opponent, but without the opponent. When near the edge of the top, press X on PS4 or press A on Xbox One to dive off.
[1:13:26] <funloverhaha> i see why this is an essential business now
[1:13:32] <dberent86> Those four middle squares can be busted through
[1:13:33] <pigbart91> lots of people still do the ddt so not banned but its really limited now. I think Miz does one and Dean Ambrose did one
[1:13:33] <metal_hip_solid> is this a Tool video?
[1:13:33] <forensic_beedrill> 15 or 20 more DDT’s, and that cage is done for
[1:13:35] <eyeonicDJ> it bent more
[1:13:45] <swegw8> i was wrong, after 2016 you can be on either side
[1:13:45] <funcle_leland> can one of you to hear the edge

[1:15:05] <ApollOrc> this might actually be worse than the ones I played in middle school
[1:15:07] <Timb0nic> It won't let you jump off unless someone is down there to be jumped on. If you wanna throw someone off grapple them near the edge and use a finisher, I think @GoOffKings
[1:15:13] <SweatyBoyWA> i think there must be a target below for you to jump off
[1:15:18] <porno_on_youtube> wrestling games from like 1997-2007 were so reliably fun, this is sad

[1:15:21] <JS_604> has there been a good wrestling game since n64?
[1:15:23] <lxandr90> To throw an opponent off cell: When near the edge of the cell with an opponent, press X on the PS4 or press A on the Xbox One to toss your opponent to the ground below

[2:33:39] <0mnivore> I like these JF sessions at the end of streams

[2:36:18] <Ghandocow> Plasma rifle melts the dude's shield
[2:36:35] <shoe3482> sucks that you have to use the shitty weapons all the time

[2:49:46] <M_Go_Dead> @artdamage my parents did that and that was all I knew growing up but that is because we lived in a part of the country that never had ricotta cheese until like 15 years ago

[3:00:32] <M_Go_Dead> @artdamage small town life, man did this start about lasagna? lol, you're good people
[3:00:35] <cosmocat69> The Prequels are the best trilogy and I will fight anyone who disagrees
[3:00:37] <0mnivore> Did you know John Williams has been nominated for 50 Oscars?
[3:00:43] <MyHeroZer0> if you ask me, our Cheeto President is the real Phantom Menace!
[3:00:46] <ChrisKyleMacLachlan> is there a PO box for yks/gok?
[3:00:50] <artdamage> man i just watched phantom menace two days ago. my kid watching SW for first time
[3:01:08] <buttbuttpeeman> love a late night king
[3:01:10] <cosmocat69> I think Walt Disney has the most ever
[3:01:23] <cosmocat69> He got nominated for all the shorts and movies
[3:01:41] <cosmocat69> Yeah it was a time when the workers had no voice
[3:01:42] <ChrisKyleMacLachlan> qui gon jinn needs a new boy servant, this one is too old
[3:01:50] <eyeonicDJ> would I be the boss of disney? yes. thanks for asking
[3:01:50] <Land_Phil> his head is frozen in arizona somewhere
[3:01:55] <Cornetto_32> I can't feel bad about the prequels after episode 9
[3:02:04] <vaaralehto> disney had great shorts
[3:02:05] <TaintEnthusiast> bring me another padawan, this one has burst
[3:02:06] <0mnivore> Walt Disney has 59

[3:02:23] <eyeonicDJ> its just star war to me
[3:02:24] <sawks> it was the last movie i saw in theater
[3:02:24] <farthammer1> Great piece of Star Wars trivia: Darth Vader was played by a bodybuilder named Greg Prowse, and NOT James Earl Jones
[3:02:25] <eyeonicDJ> its just 1 war
[3:02:34] <Cornetto_32> it's so fucking bad, and it doesn't even feel in the same realm as star wars thematically
[3:02:36] <ChrisKyleMacLachlan> i loved the part where rey rides a sled down a 10 foot hill lol
[3:02:36] <M_Go_Dead> I have not seen any of the new star wars, not as protest or anything, but I was never interested
[3:02:46] <MyHeroZer0> both the prequels and the sequels have retroactively made me just hate all of star wars. kind of a relief actually, to be done
[3:02:52] <cosmocat69> The last movie I saw in theaters was Sonic the Hedgehog
[3:02:53] <artdamage> darth vader ripped af
[3:02:54] <M_Go_Dead> I haven't seen most of the latest marvels as well
[3:02:56] <MarsIsWaiting> man this looks tough
[3:03:04] <eyeonicDJ> i just like watching them.
[3:03:08] <eyeonicDJ> they suck ass
[3:03:09] <JohnyeRobbles> JohnyeRobbles subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[3:03:10] <chrome_chomsky> jesses scared because 7 8 9 ;)
[3:03:14] <tacobellass> because they are trash
[3:03:16] <Cornetto_32> now my opinion is the prequels were cool with some bad parts and they weren't what the audience wanted
[3:03:19] <ghostlikemike> ghostlikemike subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[3:03:20] <buttbuttpeeman> Star Wars Trivia: Chewbaccus was actually a big man in a big suit
[3:03:21] <its_doggety> Everything Star Wars does now is literally workshopped in a room of 20 Star Wars nerds until they all agree on something that won’t get people mad at them
[3:03:40] <artdamage> ive always liked the prequels and knew people would come around on them eventually
[3:03:41] <farthammer1> I am on team @MyHeroZer0 . Star Wars now officially sucks
[3:03:47] <0mnivore> I thought 7 and 8 were fine and 9 was an abomination
[3:03:54] <M_Go_Dead> they are all fine movies, but not anything really interesting
[3:03:56] <friggindummy> did you see rogue one?
[3:03:58] <ChrisKyleMacLachlan> i like the racist accents in episode 1 they rule
[3:03:59] <buttbuttpeeman> they fly now?
[3:04:05] <Land_Phil> watch weekend at bernie's instead of star wars
[3:04:07] <eyeonicDJ> get them into the real shit - crypto
[3:04:09] <its_doggety> They fly now.
[3:04:11] <MyHeroZer0> thank you farthammer
[3:04:11] <0mnivore> ButtButt that was so brutal
[3:04:11] <tacobellass> best legos though
[3:04:14] <ClassicMach> Solo was ok. I liked R1
[3:04:14] <cosmocat69> The prequels rule and are rewatchable
[3:04:20] <EpochError> a yks premium theme month that requires jf and mike to read and discuss a book
[3:04:20] <Cornetto_32> lmao @chriskylemaclachlan it overwhelms me every time
[3:04:20] <Nightbot> lol
[3:04:25] <M_Go_Dead> far from home?
[3:04:27] <nasty_nasty_nasty> the animated one or the tom holland one
[3:04:33] <TaintEnthusiast> it's about a dead billionaire giving extrajudicial assasination powers to a child
[3:04:35] <maxjakerick> I saw the Empire Strikes back as a kid and was very excited by it. What a cliffhanger!
[3:04:43] <farthammer1> Spider Verse was GREAT
[3:04:43] <khajimak> animated or live action spiderman
[3:04:43] <M_Go_Dead> saw it in theaters, and it was entirely fine
[3:04:52] <artdamage> im a Dooku fan
[3:05:03] <ClassicMach> Spider verse was so so good
[3:05:13] <zany_antics> I'm too poor to even pay attention, personally
[3:05:16] <ghostlikemike> episode 2 is mostly car talking
[3:05:18] <ChrisKyleMacLachlan> hate when i have to watch the movie to understand it
[3:05:21] <friggindummy> there is millenium falcon talking
[3:05:26] <MyHeroZer0> Click and Clack? That Car Talk? hm
[3:05:29] <ChrisKyleMacLachlan> lol
[3:05:29] <Nightbot> that's funny
[3:05:30] <eyeonicDJ> they care about the spider verse but not spiders verse
[3:05:30] <farthammer1> Fun bit of Spider Verse trivia: Miles was played by a bodybuilder named Greg Prowse, and NOT James Earl Jones
[3:05:34] <maxjakerick> That was what I liked about the Irishman, you can just leave it running for an hour and then jump back in. Perfect to have playing in the background.
[3:05:36] <M_Go_Dead> into the spider verse was one of the best movies of the last 3? years
[3:05:39] <comboverjones> star wars, cerebral
[3:05:46] <buttbuttpeeman> Definitely not enough cool cars in strar wars
[3:05:47] <DJ_Dylan27> NPR kinda Car Talk?
[3:06:05] <Land_Phil> star wars should have a 1986 chrysler lebaron
[3:06:05] <MyHeroZer0> chris kyle american hero
[3:06:06] <chippybus> it's pretty bad
[3:06:10] <vaaralehto> this game looks bad ass
[3:06:15] <0mnivore> 9 is so so bad. Not worth your time
[3:06:17] <vaaralehto> lot of stuff going on though
[3:06:21] <artdamage> yea attack of the clones has all that cool coruscant car chase shit
[3:06:24] <MyHeroZer0> @GoOffKings Have you seen Turbo Kid? Watched it on Prime. Very fun!
[3:06:25] <Cornetto_32> it's justice league bad
[3:06:25] <buttbuttpeeman> @land_phil would be so fuckin sick
[3:06:28] <Cornetto_32> not bvs bad
[3:06:29] <halfnoodles> wives always be wanting to not watch movies
[3:06:29] <cheddarwarhead> 9 is easily the worst Star Wars movie
[3:06:29] <its_doggety> There is no reason to watch ep 9
[3:06:30] <cosmocat69> Solo was bad
[3:06:36] <0mnivore> Solo is better for sure
[3:06:36] <eyeonicDJ> solo more like yolo
[3:06:36] <Land_Phil> @buttbuttpeeman hell yeah dude
[3:06:37] <buttbuttpeeman> it is the first one
[3:06:39] <chippybus> star wars 9 is like a 6 year old's story about star wars "And then this! and then this! And then..."
[3:06:39] <its_doggety> Solo was fine
[3:06:43] <cosmocat69> Episode 9 is the worst Star Wars movie
[3:06:46] <M_Go_Dead> lol
[3:06:46] <Nightbot> that's funny
[3:06:47] <poojackal> movies are bad
[3:06:52] <cosmocat69> All Disney Star Wars suck
[3:06:54] <poojackal> twitch forged
[3:07:01] <poojackal> forever *
[3:07:03] <MyHeroZer0> Gory 80s sci-fi homage
[3:07:07] <nasty_nasty_nasty> solo is so dumb, mostly in a bad way but sometimes in a fun way. mostly its just totally forgettable though
[3:07:07] <JohnyeRobbles> A lotta shit going on here at once Mr Doom
[3:07:10] <buttbuttpeeman> Darth Vader drives a frickin Monte Carlo SS
[3:07:25] <eyeonicDJ> so cool
[3:07:27] <its_doggety> The clone wars animated series newest episode was the best Star Wars content to come out in the last 3 years
[3:07:33] <chippybus> solo was great when I watched it on a plane to pass the time
[3:07:52] <eyeonicDJ> what cool ppl are in solo
[3:08:03] <SoundAlerts> fart_boxer_ played Puddle of Mudd for 500 Bits
[3:08:04] <its_doggety> Phoebe Waller bridge
[3:08:06] <Cornetto_32> I'm a sucker for the underworld stuff in star wars so I liked solo but there were some dumb af parts. I liked it though
[3:08:06] <buttbuttpeeman> Jan solo
[3:08:07] <MyHeroZer0> you know what was great, guys? citizen kane. am i right? now there's a movie. classic!
[3:08:15] <ChrisKyleMacLachlan> burying a shovel on a glowing spot in the original animal crossing makes it gold the next day. rey does this but its with lightsabers lmao

[3:10:53] <its_doggety> One was clone wars, the new one is THE clone wars
[3:10:53] <farthammer1> Clone Wars...sound like this chat trying to make a Mitch's Fridge joke first
[3:10:54] <lord_googoo> it's like just the fun parts of star wars 20 min at a time, v watchable
[3:11:06] <Cornetto_32> I think it's funny how one series is so different stylistically and obviously non canon and one is like half of the star wars canon on screen, but it's the same title
[3:11:28] <MyHeroZer0> She's misunderstood
[3:11:33] <artdamage> darth maul coming back was cool

[3:13:32] <KaiSquared> great trees in there
[3:13:34] <KaiSquared> trees
[3:13:36] <Land_Phil> it's way more embrassing to admit to still liking harry potter than LOTR
[3:13:37] <KaiSquared> get it?
[3:13:38] <MyHeroZer0> i think star wars or marvel are way more embarrassing to admit to
[3:13:40] <RadishGiant> two towers, top tier ps2 game
[3:13:40] <farthammer1> Yeah admitting to liking nerdy stuff like LOTR is embarrassing.
[3:13:41] <KaiSquared> for the holidays
[3:13:44] <cosmocat69> LoTR rules
[3:13:44] <KaiSquared> the holidaze
[3:13:57] <its_doggety> Ah ok cool. I downloaded one of the old LOTR games and have been playing it. Still a lot of fun
[3:14:12] <M_Go_Dead> a class on LOTR or a class on Tolkien in college?
[3:14:15] <hug_nicemann> pobody's nerfect
[3:14:16] <TheGreatCactusJac> Doom guy just stabbed that pulsating turd
[3:14:19] <Land_Phil> lovecraft has cool stories and also a very racist person
[3:14:20] <cosmocat69> Yeah the politics are reactionary but the wizard shit is fun as fuck
[3:14:31] <migrainethresher> do it
[3:14:32] <ApollOrc> the second one gets weird
[3:14:36] <TaintEnthusiast> it's a long-ass game
[3:14:41] <TaintEnthusiast> nemesis?
[3:14:41] <KaiSquared> so is this doom game worth it?
[3:14:42] <friggindummy> fun game
[3:14:51] <Land_Phil> heinlein is okay and hes a liberatarian or whatever
[3:14:52] <chrome_chomsky> you talkin tolkein 101
[3:15:03] <buttbuttpeeman> Charles Lindbergh wrote some really good deep sci-fi, but he's got his own things too...
[3:15:12] <its_doggety> I was talking about Battle for middle earth which I don’t think you would like bc it’s an RTS but yeah Shadow of Mordor was great too
[3:15:13] <artdamage> i remember palying the helms deep scene in some game at some point
[3:15:15] <artdamage> kicking ladders
[3:15:39] <considerthetetrapod> the ps2 lotr games ruled when I was a kid
[3:15:41] <its_doggety> @artdamage yeah that was the movie adaptation I think
[3:15:42] <cosmocat69> LOTR 3 for PC was fun. Tried to install it on my computer last year but it wouldn’t let me. So Pisa’s
[3:15:44] <coach_mike_dan_tony> I'm reading through lotr now and o have to say the frodo/Sam scenes are honestly the worst parts of the books
[3:15:45] <KaiSquared> wait do you have the bfg?
[3:15:45] <cosmocat69> Pissed
[3:16:06] <farthammer1> he has BFG
[3:16:14] <KaiSquared> damn that's sick
[3:16:17] <MyHeroZer0> at least the LOTR movies have some prestige on them, with the Oscar wins. for whatever that's worth
[3:16:17] <TaintEnthusiast> middle earth: shadow of war is the second shadow of mordor. It takes an incredibly long time to get rolling
[3:16:31] <cosmocat69> The LOTR books are so good. I grew up with the movies but the books converted me into a massive fan. The prose is so good

[3:17:26] <oldnick42> Jesse do you have Mastery tokens to spend on the top upgrades?
[3:17:28] <farthammer1> Remote detonate is such a clutch weapon
[3:17:35] <Ghandocow> I get why people don't like the LOTR books because they're like "we're gonna describe a tree for 5 pages" but it's the best IMO
[3:17:59] <oldnick42> I think you do.
[3:18:02] <oldnick42> Those are the yellow ones.

[3:18:15] <oldnick42> That means you can insta-unlock the top tier abilities for weapons.
[3:18:23] <oldnick42> The ones where you've bought all the other upgrades.
[3:18:27] <buttbuttpeeman> There's more currency in this game than the friggin Fort Knox
[3:19:44] <oldnick42> The shotgun one seems tempting, you use that a lot.
[3:19:50] <McBigDingus> microwave sucks
[3:19:53] <M_Go_Dead> isn't the latest conspiracy that fort knox has no gold and we'll all die soon?
[3:20:00] <oldnick42> The other shotgun mode
[3:20:04] <cosmocat69> SYFY is doing a four day Battlestar Galactica marathon. Anyone else watch that show? It’s the best ever. Will defend the finale to my grave

[3:22:33] <M_Go_Dead> so roughly end game
[3:22:34] <its_doggety> It’s so funny to me that trump calls corona “the invisible enemy”
[3:22:44] <durango_caviar> driving down the viewer count
[3:22:44] <TheGreatCactusJac> I remember there being some news story about a North Korean general being strapped to an anti-aircrafft gun and killed. Six months later he turned up alive. Whoops.

[3:35:38] <artdamage> great age, great show

[3:35:46] <carpenter_groot> 24 was probably the best age of my life
[3:35:47] <MyHeroZer0> i thought you were going to say the show
[3:35:50] <LilacWhimski> i'm older than jesse by a few years and the only thing i do that is age appropriate is have a job that would qualify as a career and just got a mortgage finally

[3:43:14] <EpochError> While many of you are likely yelling “GO PATRIOTS” or “GO RAMS!” I’m yelling “GO ROBERT MUELLER and the rule of law!” #SuperBowl2019Atlanta— Brian Krassenstein (@krassenstein) February 3, 2019
[3:43:58] <nasty_nasty_nasty> they just don't make posters like the krassensteins anymore. miss em
[3:44:00] <friggindummy> @EpochError holy shit that is real??
[3:44:15] <0mnivore> That's the quintessential Krassenstein tweet

[3:44:32] <twotontesticle> Damn jf that sparkling water got you up all night
[3:44:49] <EpochError> definitely real, although theyre suspended so you cant go to the actual tweet page
[3:44:50] <Cornetto_32> waiting for that text

[3:45:58] <EpochError> @serpentine666 lol

[3:46:01] <nasty_nasty_nasty> great post @serpentine666
[3:46:21] <nasty_nasty_nasty> putting the diamond next to his name so it looks halfway like a blue check out of the corner of your eye is a great bit

[3:46:41] <sawks> wifes do be finding stuff
[3:46:48] <JasonUnknown> !bundt
[3:46:48] <Nightbot> I bought a bundt cake for Jesse about a month ago. When I brought it home, he got irritated because he has been trying to eat healthier. So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today.
[3:46:50] <SoundAlerts> TaintEnthusiast played Rude for 50 Bits
