So then a week later I see the bundt cake on the counter still and throw it away. Same day he asks me where the bundt cake is because he actually wanted to eat it. So yeah, I bought four today.

[2:11:17] <Nightbot> A few months ago I purchased a Venus for myself. It gives me orgasms without ever getting erect, and easier than oral sex from my wife. We still hug, kiss, and cuddle but now we both can have all the orgasms we wish. Modern technology is wonderful! note: they also own a Sybian
