[0:15:46] <UnPocoLoco23> It's more funny you sharing the experience of doing that the joke lol
[0:15:47] <gabagooligan> Or I‚Äôm having dejaview
[0:15:52] <doubledarkhorse> you may be over estimating how much people know about star wars
[0:15:54] <biggest_fans> I would put all the apologies after the joke, hit the shock value.
[0:16:01] <dipshed> rob needs to apologize to SlickDaddy, now
[0:16:12] <WheezTheSnus> would have been better at the end of the set
[0:16:12] <ghostlikemike> i dont think thats the crux of the issue stefan
[0:16:18] <ColdStoneSteveAustin> @stefanandjesse have you heard of Enter the Gungeon? would be a good stream game
[0:16:19] <YKSFAN> Let‚Äôs really break this joke down
[0:16:27] <rodzirvin> I think the joke works, but not as an opener
[0:16:29] <bimmy> i've never seen star wars and i get the joke
[0:16:30] <dgbnr> I love the joke
[0:16:39] <gabagooligan> cheer100 good joke rob
[0:16:41] <springconvert> That‚Äôs a good point
[0:16:41] <biggest_fans> I think the stormtroopers having bad aim is pretty common knowledge at this point.
[0:16:45] <Rolyatkcinmai> Even people who have seen the movies may not be in on the exact accuracy percentages of the storm troopers
[0:16:46] <staryuyu> What game is Jesse playing rn?
[0:16:54] <FatAaron> as a slick daddy I would like an apology
[0:16:55] <123balls_> stefan, give jesse your switch
[0:16:59] <garyoussy> hey stefan have you gotten enter the gungeon for the switch yet? I missed it the last 8 times you said it on stream

[0:18:31] <ShooterMart> Jesse's not good at games... He's *great* at games
[0:18:32] <anyonebutrazza> you have to be good at games to make partner
[0:18:33] <thurstonfalco> ive seen much worse streams get partner

[0:18:46] <dipshed> rob's views on mexicans might keep you guys out
[0:18:46] <johnwaynegassy> god damn better
[0:18:47] <d_o_n_n_y_> twitch partners? are we talking about a polyamorous relationship?
[0:18:47] <pigvape> if not we can ask the #avengers for help
[0:18:50] <TransLaraCroft> I only downloaded twitch to watch this if u don't get partner I'll delete
[0:18:55] <garyoussy> I think you need to give an explicit breakdown of the financials on stream before they give you partner
[0:18:55] <LRonFrancis> Go alt right and you'll make partner
[0:19:01] <fancypantsberni> okie dokie partner
[0:19:02] <executivelazers> wait is it not like you guys getting paid
[0:19:02] <Don_Kee> Based on your MASSIVE social following you‚Äôll get it
[0:19:05] <pvtBoolean> twitch is poly
[0:19:07] <anyonebutrazza> Might not get partner but might get pard'ner
[0:19:08] <hambonekrh> howdy pardner.
[0:19:09] <springconvert> If you guys don‚Äôt get partner, I‚Äôm going to sell all my twitch stock
[0:19:14] <OrenthalGames> i just graduated college baby
[0:19:14] <billmaher42069> i think the avengers tweet needs to be an emote.
[0:19:16] <Rolyatkcinmai> Imagine how good Jesse's apology video will be once he gets partner and fucks everything up though.
[0:19:18] <NoamChompy> You guys are definitely at or above min partner level viewership
[0:19:23] <thredds> you can
[0:19:40] <Hank____Scorpio> Jesse has solo streams where he just talks about how much money he has
[0:19:40] <rock__solid> jesse are you gonna take that green screen down after every stream???
[0:19:40] <nausium> (((F L A V O R S)))
[0:19:41] <pigvape> "we're white, it's cool"

[0:19:48] <ghostlikemike> stay on rob
[0:19:48] <munt69> go off
[0:19:52] <nickconga> rob, I'm mexican, you have permission from me to go off
[0:19:54] <BaguetteMonk> its fine jf, everyone knows that sub ratio thing
[0:19:55] <springconvert> I love tasting people
[0:19:56] <TransLaraCroft> Get off rob
[0:19:58] <thredds> rob so spicy
[0:19:58] <turnpike74> Stay on rob
[0:20:00] <garyoussy> the offensive part is that they're actually Salvadoran
[0:20:01] <Hank____Scorpio> Rob don't do it
[0:20:02] <biggest_fans> Jesse thinks Mexican people are offensive.
[0:20:03] <SurkovFan420> drag him
[0:20:03] <d_o_n_n_y_> rob loves walking around and pointing out what race people are
[0:20:04] <ShooterMart> Rob "All Lives Matter" Whisman
[0:20:05] <gabagooligan> cheer100 There‚Äôs so many flavours of human beans
[0:20:06] <considerthetetrapod> instead point out when somebody ISNT mexican
[0:20:06] <doubledarkhorse> it's only offensive if they're some other flavor of mexican
[0:20:07] <hambonekrh> try to become cryptopartner. tons of upside. #fuckpartner
[0:20:12] <Rolyatkcinmai> Rob is having a heated gaming moment
[0:20:15] <diaped_up_ready_2_cum> flavors of human beings... what is this guy jeffrey dahmer?
[0:20:16] <MizoGUCCI> rob you can't refer to mexicans as "the spicy humans"
[0:20:17] <HandsomeNormalMan> #imwithrob
[0:20:22] <uzbabylon0675j> "we're white its cool"
[0:20:23] <rodzirvin> Only way it's wrong to point out if someone's mexican is if it's that person isn't mexican
[0:20:28] <UnPocoLoco23> #FuckTheWall
[0:20:28] <springconvert> Much love rob
[0:20:29] <NHLPlayerToreyKrug> oh hey the chat fixed when I refreshed
[0:20:30] <thredds> #stillwithrob
[0:20:30] <Sinesthetic> if you don't get partnered, just start a rival streaming platform called like 'glitch' or something
[0:20:32] <biggest_fans> Rob "Mexican Ally" Whisman
[0:20:33] <FatAaron> needs to be bigger and clear
[0:20:33] <twisty6666> rob wants to have sex with the wall
[0:20:38] <nausium> if rob were a flavor hed be sugar free vanilla that's somehow racist
[0:20:41] <C00LlN> go off rob!
[0:20:44] <yarightdude> Rob is #TeamEarlyPinkFloyd
[0:20:48] <d_o_n_n_y_> it was ian miles cheong defending pewdiepie
[0:21:27] <dipshed> it is different, Rob isn't even the one gaming while he has a michael richards moment
[0:21:32] <rodzirvin> Rob "Amigo de los Mexicanos" Whisman
[0:21:35] <hambonekrh> supporting the wall will help you become partner.
[0:21:36] <garyoussy> Tork Prime
[0:21:37] <considerthetetrapod> you guys should send some gamer cum merch to the twitch team
[0:21:38] <John_Olerud_> #NonPrimeSubscriber

[0:54:46] <springconvert> Jeese is doing great
[0:54:54] <real_cool_guy> it's interesting to hear about sports commentators, but I wonder if anyone knows any brainless advice from "the old football coach"
[0:54:58] <mrlazyeyes> There was a sports commentator that, after listening to a co-commentator tell a story about playing catch with his dad as a boy simply responded "...that's pretty gay" then realized and immediately apologized
[0:55:05] <UnPocoLoco23> There is a soccer player who scored on his old team and celebrated by doing a backflip. Afterwards they asked him about his celebration and he said it was the saddest backflip of his life.
[0:55:09] <nude_tayne> rogue legacy would be a good jesse stream game
[0:55:17] <ShooterMart> So glad someone else has heard that, the accent alone is something else @johnwaynegassy
[0:55:19] <keepo__man> lee corso saying fuck

[0:55:39] <bogenbroom> Binding of Isaac
[0:55:39] <shoe3482> roguelite requires RPG elements
[0:55:42] <real_cool_guy> cuphead isn't bullet hell either my friend.
[0:55:45] <TechIssueLiar> jesse plays dungeon crawl stone soup
[0:55:50] <cALICO_ACID> dead cells is a way better version of rogue legacy imo
[0:55:50] <billmaher42069> can we get a jesse dark souls?
[0:55:51] <doubledarkhorse> rogue legacy is so good
[0:55:52] <keepo__man> rouge legacy is good
[0:55:58] <GlassRadish> I love Rogue Legacy
[0:56:05] <shoe3482> cuphead is so bullet hell. maybe not extreme bullet hell, but some
[0:56:07] <keepo__man> jesse should play spelunky

[0:56:50] <WillieNorthpole> folks I would love to watch some Crash Bandicoot
[0:56:50] <cALICO_ACID> spelunky would be good

[1:04:21] <ScubaDoo86> pro sectional
[1:04:21] <bilbofeetcumtribute> More like sex-tionals
[1:04:22] <misterlunchtime> sectionals fucking rule, good for laying down
[1:04:22] <yarightdude> Sections depend on the room
[1:04:22] <real_cool_guy> come apart easily, but more flexible
[1:04:22] <krebex> If you have the room, go for it
[1:04:23] <keepo__man> bad
[1:04:24] <GlassRadish> you'll be doing it
[1:04:24] <shoe3482> I never had one, my house is too small for a sectional i think
[1:04:24] <ghostlikemike> good stuff tbh
[1:04:26] <doktortoboggan> Pro sectional
[1:04:27] <biggest_fans> Mine won't stay together.
[1:04:31] <gabagooligan> Sectionals are good
[1:04:31] <thredds> in the right room they're great
[1:04:31] <Docm30> They're good
[1:04:32] <bizzyunderscore> Sectionals arent Real couched
[1:04:32] <WillieNorthpole> I have a sectional, and i'm not sure i'd ever have that silly combo again
[1:04:32] <shoe3482> we have the couch love seat chair combo
[1:04:33] <rodzirvin> I'm super pro sectional
[1:04:34] <MizoGUCCI> more like SUCKtional
[1:04:35] <bogenbroom> sectionals are a massive improvement over the traditional couch
[1:04:36] <Hank____Scorpio> 12 person velvet sectional
[1:04:38] <imkilgore> intersectional
[1:04:39] <springconvert> Love a good sectional if you have the space
[1:04:41] <considerthetetrapod> sectionals always seemed like exclusively for wild fuckin
[1:04:42] <bizzyunderscore> Sectionals are lies
[1:04:47] <Sinesthetic> chez lounge or gtfo
[1:04:49] <mrlazyeyes> how about this, sectionals that stack instead of going side to side
[1:04:52] <LRonFrancis> It can be rigid if you want to mix up the design
[1:04:52] <Hank____Scorpio> When Rob and Stefan sit on any couch it becomes a loveseat
[1:04:52] <gabagooligan> If you have a good one. I bought a couch/loveseat combo and regret it
[1:04:53] <bizzyunderscore> Fucj the wedge
[1:04:59] <WillieNorthpole> Jesse - buy a sectional and a chair - game is changed
[1:05:04] <ScubaDoo86> we used to prefer to the wedge seat as the "chump seat"
[1:05:04] <d_o_n_n_y_> are you gonna talk about the buying process or are you gonna pussy out like mike did on yks
[1:05:10] <springconvert> Yeah obviously
[1:05:10] <drewsgoodtweets> sectionals come before regionals
[1:05:11] <shoe3482> if you're laying sideways you can use it
[1:05:13] <shoe3482> cats can use it
[1:05:13] <biggest_fans> We have a big ass sectional and it's dope.
[1:05:14] <thredds> the wedge is where our dog hangs out
[1:05:16] <springconvert> I don‚Äôt know what the wedge is
[1:05:17] <YKSFAN> Couches need to be long enough that lay on.
[1:05:18] <yarightdude> Hey Jesse, how bout giving us a thorough tour of your house so we can get a better idea of how the section would fit
[1:05:21] <doubledarkhorse> you put remotes and stuff in the wedge compartment
[1:05:21] <goat_attack> I gotta go with the traditional couch
[1:05:22] <springconvert> I can‚Äôt picture it
[1:05:25] <gabagooligan> Sectional with a chez lounge is primo
[1:05:25] <bizzyunderscore> The wedge sitter has logged on
[1:05:27] <d_o_n_n_y_> in my experience, kids love those wedges
[1:05:29] <ghostlikemike> thats a simpsons joke
[1:05:35] <IntraMedium> The wedge is for people who need the built in cup holders in their couch.
[1:05:48] <Sinesthetic> a couch fit for mr antilles himself
[1:05:52] <springconvert> I‚Äôve never seen a curved sectional
[1:05:55] <105iq> jesses gamer name. 'The Wedge'
[1:06:00] <d_o_n_n_y_> jesse i guarantee you that your kids will love the wedge
[1:06:02] <gabagooligan> cheer19 sectional with a chez lounge
[1:06:05] <garyoussy> most of them are curved and 5", this is normal
[1:06:08] <umjammer_danny> i used to have a wedge couch
[1:06:08] <mcdaines> Hey did Jesse change his gamer name yet
[1:06:11] <GlassRadish> like a C shape?
[1:06:13] <keepo__man> does jesse have a curved tv
[1:06:14] <bizzyunderscore> Couch wth cup holder and recliner built in is great for my gout
[1:06:16] <shoe3482> put the sectional google search on screen please
[1:06:20] <WillieNorthpole> Jesse seems to have some bastardized understanding of what a sectional is
[1:06:21] <real_cool_guy> can we get a sectional on the stream please
[1:06:21] <misterlunchtime> Jesse "The Sectional Wedge" Farrar
[1:06:22] <springconvert> Jesse no one knows about this but you
[1:06:25] <Rolyatkcinmai> they're all 90 degree angles lol
[1:06:25] <Galloughs> i cannot for the life of me figure out what jesse is talking about
[1:06:26] <gabagooligan> cheer1 chaise lounge? Idk how it‚Äôs spelled
[1:06:28] <garyoussy> 90 degress is different in metric
[1:06:31] <real_cool_guy> sectional pic of the stream
[1:06:31] <mrlazyeyes> 4 corner sectionals making a dyson sphere around the potted plant
[1:06:31] <biggest_fans> A curved leather sectional with 50 cupholders is a must for every dad's media room.
[1:06:32] <considerthetetrapod> remember when this show was them all roundtable discussing the ways they honk off
[1:06:34] <nickconga> jesse's been looking at some fucked up sectionals
[1:06:36] <d_o_n_n_y_> jesse it's a 90 degree angle
[1:06:39] <yarightdude> sectional.google.com
[1:06:39] <bizzyunderscore> Is it 90 degrees in inches or cm
[1:06:41] <springconvert> Jesse this is insane
[1:06:42] <johnwaynegassy> This is the content I crave
[1:06:42] <Docm30> I don't know what the wedge is
[1:06:44] <spaceshiplaw> this is the best fucking fight
[1:06:45] <Knul> most of them are 90 degrees on google jesse
[1:06:47] <GlassRadish> I hate it when my two dads fight
[1:06:48] <spaceshiplaw> i love this content
[1:06:49] <hambonekrh> jesse wears curve cologne from 1999.
[1:06:56] <John_Olerud_> angle chat with Jesse "The Wedge" Farrar
[1:06:57] <mcdaines> @stefanandjesse I don‚Äôt wanna be a hater, but I gotta day I‚Äôm pretty disappointed in the OBS overlay tonight
[1:06:57] <bizzyunderscore> 90 degrees in f or c
[1:06:58] <Hank____Scorpio> "Sectional" is the Canadian word for "Middle School"
[1:07:01] <keepo__man> jesse is wrong
[1:07:04] <yarightdude> Thank you for agreeing, Jesse
[1:07:05] <MizoGUCCI> 90% of sectionals are 90 degrees
[1:07:08] <bogenbroom> some dont have a wedge
[1:07:09] <bizzyunderscore> Stares where
[1:07:12] <bogenbroom> they just are a right angle
[1:07:12] <springconvert> The Google Sectional needs some settings configured before it can answer that
[1:07:15] <Rolyatkcinmai> jesse don't have a heated gaming moment about sectionals
[1:07:15] <IntraMedium> chaise lounge sections are the only appropriate sectionals
[1:07:16] <real_cool_guy> JF let's get a pic of what you're talking about on the stream please
[1:07:23] <krebex> it's 90 degress with a chamfer

[1:07:49] <turnpike74> love to argue about google results one person can see
[1:07:52] <yarightdude> Thank you Jesse
[1:07:55] <mrlazyeyes> the sectional should be replaced with a giant cupholder, large enough to hold a person or a car tire

[1:09:55] <keepo__man> did jesse see star wars
[1:10:02] <biggest_fans> I'm not going to click on it, what does the "Chocolate" in the url refer to?
[1:10:15] <WillieNorthpole> you can condition them
[1:10:19] <doubledarkhorse> only get professional bowlers as suggested follows
[1:10:20] <real_cool_guy> you can make the sims be gay right?
[1:10:20] <turnpike74> I get flat earth groups on Facebook bc of rgs
[1:10:22] <springconvert> Good idea
[1:10:25] <misterlunchtime> jesse said being gay is a choice
[1:10:26] <bizzyunderscore> Customers Also Purchased
[1:10:27] <Rolyatkcinmai> Wow Jesse just said being gay is a choice
[1:10:29] <springconvert> Lol
[1:10:36] <d_o_n_n_y_> jesse, being gay is not a choice
[1:10:40] <springconvert> Now you‚Äôre talkin my language
[1:10:47] <ghostlikemike> when is the jesse sim stream
[1:10:49] <bizzyunderscore> Being Jesse is a choice
[1:10:52] <Hank____Scorpio> Can you be a toilet in the Sims? Asking for a friend.
[1:10:54] <Docm30> It was in the original, but it was glitch they sold as a feature
[1:10:56] <springconvert> I choose to be gay
[1:11:09] <thredds> KappaPride
[1:11:10] <considerthetetrapod> it's about damn time gamers became homophobic.
[1:11:13] <bizzyunderscore> I choos to be gay in twitch chat
[1:11:23] <IntraMedium> jesse wants the kind of sectional that might as well just be a bed in your living room
[1:11:24] <WillieNorthpole> I had to delete the Sims because my wife left me for my female neighbor even though I put a pool table in the bedroom
[1:11:25] <garyoussy> jesse has the courage to take a stand against all the SJWs in gaming
[1:11:26] <Hank____Scorpio> Stefan uses Google Canada so it only searches geocities pages
[1:11:29] <swappingspit> i'm very shocked jesse thinks being gay is a choice
[1:11:30] <John_Olerud_> try Bing
[1:11:35] <sharkbutt> stefan/rob how was dave and busters?
[1:11:35] <d_o_n_n_y_> cant believe jesse is homophobic

[1:11:50] <pvtBoolean> I still don't know what a wedge is

[1:59:53] <BrettW7> I would just wear a white t shirt and hold two beers
[2:00:06] <d_o_n_n_y_> dressing as jesse for halloween is cultural appropriation
[2:00:10] <umjammer_danny> 10s of millions?
[2:00:18] <YKSFAN> Jesse costume: white shirt covered in grass clippings. Fedora and two plastic cups
[2:00:19] <ghostlikemike> i'd also say "im the beer idiot" a lot

[2:00:47] <springconvert> That what he did in question
[2:00:50] <Rolyatkcinmai> DrDisrespect makes like $150,000 a year at most. Which is a ton for being a shit head online, but lol millions
[2:00:53] <lordbeef> who is this guy, seth abramson?
[2:00:55] <ghostlikemike> game a bit quiet
[2:00:58] <mooingmoose> what does "mocking people blindly" mean

[2:01:10] <springconvert> I'm a stream user
[2:01:12] <cALICO_ACID> there is some incredible #notallmen stuff that came from the disrespect fiasco
[2:01:13] <GlassRadish> what a dipshit
[2:01:19] <John_Olerud_> he's not a Bond villain but game streamer sure is an Odd Job
[2:01:21] <LRonFrancis> I've read Vanity Fair exposes shorter than that.
[2:01:21] <misterlunchtime> i use the stefan and jesse gamer stream as an escape when my real life is not depressing enough
[2:01:22] <mooingmoose> why couldn't that guy just say "villain" lol
[2:01:28] <d_o_n_n_y_> imagine actually caring about losers who stream video games
[2:01:28] <pvtBoolean> "hot, good, 410 pounds" is the text of my tinder profile
[2:01:29] <krebex> yowch
[2:01:30] <Sinesthetic> judge the streamer by their subs
[2:01:37] <dipshed> DrDisrespect liked that James Browns tweet.

[2:01:40] <nickconga> "jesse farrar apologizes to the slick daddy club after cheating on the Tork corporation with a Georgia Pacific model 59498"
[2:01:49] <JaggedLittleBill> That guy made less sense than Rob dragging Dave and Busters
[2:01:50] <GlassRadish> that dude was frothing at the mouth as he wrote that
[2:01:51] <dh2121> my dad used to make me eat old as leftovers all the time

[2:03:02] <fupasly> "My daughter isn't canon"
[2:03:08] <CovfefeDobson> tork supports cheating on your wife
[2:03:11] <springconvert> This guy's name is a dang Bronze Hammer!!
[2:03:13] <rodzirvin> I mean, JF is definitely superior
[2:03:15] <GlassRadish> I'd never heard of this guy before the Jesse tweet and now I know his weird ass fans are almost cult like in their devotion
[2:03:19] <Loucifer_> drdisrespect must stream hearthstone until he learns humility
[2:03:29] <misterlunchtime> yeah jesse, you think youre better than this guy just because you dont cheat on your wife and cry about it to everyone
[2:03:29] <John_Olerud_> they're responding to his Taco Bell breakfast tweets
[2:03:30] <keepo__man> stefan i feel bad for this guy https://twitter.com/ambientaxion/status/941514584715821058
